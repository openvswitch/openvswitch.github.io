.SH NAME
ovs-vswitchd\fR.conf\fR.db \- Open_vSwitch database schema
.PP
A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open
vSwitch daemon\fR.  The top-level configuration for the daemon is the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table, which must have exactly one
record\fR.  Records in other tables are significant only when they
can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\fR.  Records that are not reachable from
the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted
from the database, except for records in a few distinguished
``root set\(cq\(cq tables\fR.
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
Most tables contain two special columns, named \fBother_config\fR
and \fBexternal_ids\fR\fR.  These columns have the same form and
purpose each place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space
later\fR.
.RS
.TP
\fBother_config\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used features\fR.  Supported keys,
along with the forms taken by their values, are documented individually
for each table\fR.
.IP
A few tables do not have \fBother_config\fR columns because no
key-value pairs have yet been defined for them\fR.
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open
vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself\fR.  System integrators should
either use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on
common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be
unique\fR.  In some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined that are
likely to be widely useful, they are documented individually for each
table\fR.

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

.IP "\fBbridges\fR: set of \fBBridge\fRs"
Set of bridges managed by the daemon\fR.
.IP "\fBssl\fR: optional \fBSSL\fR"
SSL used globally by the daemon\fR.
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : system-id\fR: optional string"
A unique identifier for the Open vSwitch\(cqs physical host\fR.
The form of the identifier depends on the type of the host\fR.
On a Citrix XenServer, this will likely be the same as
\fBexternal_ids:xs-system-uuid\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : xs-system-uuid\fR: optional string"
The Citrix XenServer universally unique identifier for the physical

.IP "\fBother_config : stats-update-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 5,000"
Interval for updating statistics to the database, in milliseconds\fR.
This option will affect the update of the \fBstatistics\fR
column in the following tables: \fBPort\fR, \fBInterface
\fR, \fBMirror\fR\fR.
.IP
Default value is 5000 ms\fR.
.IP
Getting statistics more frequently can be achieved via OpenFlow\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : flow-restore-wait\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts up, it has an empty flow table
and therefore it handles all arriving packets in its default fashion
according to its configuration, by dropping them or sending them to
an OpenFlow controller or switching them as a standalone switch\fR.
This behavior is ordinarily desirable\fR.  However, if
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is restarting as part of a ``hot-upgrade,\(cq\(cq
then this leads to a relatively long period during which packets are
mishandled\fR.
.IP
This option allows for improvement\fR.  When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
starts with this value set as \fBtrue\fR, it will neither
flush or expire previously set datapath flows nor will it send and
receive any packets to or from the datapath\fR.  When this value is
later set to \fBfalse\fR, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will
start receiving packets from the datapath and re-setup the flows\fR.
.IP
Thus, with this option, the procedure for a hot-upgrade of
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR becomes roughly the following:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Stop \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR\fR.
.IP 2. .25in

.IP "\fBother_config : flow-limit\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
The maximum
number of flows allowed in the datapath flow table\fR.  Internally OVS

based on real time network conditions\fR.
.IP
The default is 200000\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : n-dpdk-rxqs\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the maximum number of rx queues to be created for each dpdk

similar to the dpdk EAL \(cq-c COREMASK\(cq option input or the \(cqtaskset\(cq
mask input\fR.
.IP
The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU core\fR.  A set bit
means the corresponding core is available and a pmd thread will be
created and pinned to it\fR.  If the input does not cover all cores,
those uncovered cores are considered not set\fR.
.IP
If not specified, one pmd thread will be created for each numa node
and pinned to any available core on the numa node by default\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : n-handler-threads\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the number of threads for software datapaths to use for
handling new flows\fR.  The default the number of online CPU cores minus
the number of revalidators\fR.
.IP
This configuration is per datapath\fR.  If you have more than one
software datapath (e\fR.g\fR. some \fBsystem\fR bridges and some

.IP "\fBother_config : n-revalidator-threads\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the number of threads for software datapaths to use for
revalidating flows in the datapath\fR.  Typically, there is a direct
correlation between the number of revalidator threads, and the number
of flows allowed in the datapath\fR.  The default is the number of cpu
cores divided by four plus one\fR.  If \fBn\-handler\-threads\fR is
set, the default changes to the number of cpu cores minus the number
of handler threads\fR.
.IP
This configuration is per datapath\fR.  If you have more than one

a process name, will exist for each running Open vSwitch
daemon process, with \fIname\fR replaced by the
daemon\(cqs name (e\fR.g\fR. \fBprocess_ovs\-vswitchd\fR)\fR.  The

was not, then the crash count will always be 0 and the two
durations will always be the same\fR.  If \fB\-\-monitor\fR
was given, then the crash count may be positive; if it is, the
latter duration is the amount of time since the most recent crash

.ST "Version Reporting:"
These columns report the types and versions of the hardware and

with with any kernel version\fR.  Some reasons do exist to insist on
particular user/kernel pairings\fR.  First, newer kernel versions add
new features, that can only be used by new-enough userspace, e\fR.g\fR.

versions\fR.  Second, as an extension to the first reason, some newer
kernel versions add new features for enhancing performance that only
new-enough userspace versions can take advantage of\fR.

An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN specified in the
\fBtag\fR column\fR.  Packets egressing on an access port
have no 802\fR.1Q header\fR.
.IP
Any packet with an 802\fR.1Q header with a nonzero VLAN ID that
ingresses on an access port is dropped, regardless of whether the
VLAN ID in the header is the access port\(cqs VLAN ID\fR.
.TP
native-tagged
A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with the exception that
a packet without an 802\fR.1Q header that ingresses on a native-tagged
port is in the ``native VLAN\(cq\(cq (specified in the \fBtag\fR
column)\fR.
.TP
native-untagged
A native-untagged port resembles a native-tagged port, with the
exception that a packet that egresses on a native-untagged port in
the native VLAN will not have an 802\fR.1Q header\fR.
.RE
.PP
A packet will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of
the packet, as described by the rules above\fR.
.IP "\fBvlan_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBaccess\fR, \fBnative\-tagged\fR, \fBnative\-untagged\fR, or \fBtrunk\fR"
The VLAN mode of the port, as described above\fR.  When this column is
empty, a default mode is selected as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
If \fBtag\fR contains a value, the port is an access
port\fR.  The \fBtrunks\fR column should be empty\fR.
.IP \(bu
Otherwise, the port is a trunk port\fR.  The \fBtrunks\fR
column value is honored if it is present\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
For an access port, the port\(cqs implicitly tagged VLAN\fR.  For a
native-tagged or native-untagged port, the port\(cqs native VLAN\fR.  Must
be empty if this is a trunk port\fR.
.IP "\fBtrunks\fR: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095"
For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the 802\fR.1Q VLAN
or VLANs that this port trunks; if it is empty, then the port trunks
all VLANs\fR.  Must be empty if this is an access port\fR.
.IP
A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its native
VLAN, regardless of whether \fBtrunks\fR includes that
VLAN\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : priority-tags\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
An 802\fR.1Q header contains two important pieces of information: a VLAN
ID and a priority\fR.  A frame with a zero VLAN ID, called a
``priority-tagged\(cq\(cq frame, is supposed to be treated the same way as
a frame without an 802\fR.1Q header at all (except for the priority)\fR.
.IP
However, some network elements ignore any frame that has 802\fR.1Q
header at all, even when the VLAN ID is zero\fR.  Therefore, by default
Open vSwitch does not output priority-tagged frames, instead omitting
the 802\fR.1Q header entirely if the VLAN ID is zero\fR.  Set this key to
\fBtrue\fR to enable priority-tagged frames on a port\fR.
.IP
Regardless of this setting, Open vSwitch omits the 802\fR.1Q header on
output if both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero\fR.
.IP
All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero VLAN ID, so
this setting is not meaningful on native-tagged ports\fR.
.ST "Bonding Configuration:"
A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port\fR.\(cq\(cq Bonding
allows for load balancing and fail-over\fR.
.PP
The following types of bonding will work with any kind of upstream
switch\fR.  On the upstream switch, do not configure the interfaces as a
bond:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-slb\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on source MAC address and output
VLAN, with periodic rebalancing as traffic patterns change\fR.
.TP
\fBactive\-backup\fR
Assigns all flows to one slave, failing over to a backup slave when
the active slave is disabled\fR.  This is the only bonding mode in which
interfaces may be plugged into different upstream switches\fR.
.RE
.PP
The following modes require the upstream switch to support 802\fR.3ad with
successful LACP negotiation\fR. If LACP negotiation fails and
other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is true, then \fBactive\-backup\fR
mode is used:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-tcp\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on L2, L3, and L4 protocol
information such as destination MAC address, IP address, and TCP
port\fR.
.RE
.PP
These columns apply only to bonded ports\fR.  Their values are
otherwise ignored\fR.
.IP "\fBbond_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\-backup\fR, \fBbalance\-tcp\fR, or \fBbalance\-slb\fR"
The type of bonding used for a bonded port\fR.  Defaults to
\fBactive\-backup\fR if unset\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-hash-basis\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An integer hashed along with flows when choosing output slaves in load
balanced bonds\fR.  When changed, all flows will be assigned different
hash values possibly causing slave selection decisions to change\fR.  Does
not affect bonding modes which do not employ load balancing such as
\fBactive\-backup\fR\fR.
.ST "Link Failure Detection:"
An important part of link bonding is detecting that links are down so
that they may be disabled\fR.  These settings determine how Open vSwitch
detects link failure\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-detect-mode\fR: optional string, either \fBmiimon\fR or \fBcarrier\fR"
The means used to detect link failures\fR.  Defaults to
\fBcarrier\fR which uses each interface\(cqs carrier to detect
failures\fR.  When set to \fBmiimon\fR, will check for failures
by polling each interface\(cqs MII\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-miimon-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The interval, in milliseconds, between successive attempts to poll
each interface\(cqs MII\fR.  Relevant only when \fBother_config:bond-detect-mode\fR is \fBmiimon\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBbond_updelay\fR: integer"
The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay up on an
interface before the interface is considered to be up\fR.  Specify
\fB0\fR to enable the interface immediately\fR.
.IP
This setting is honored only when at least one bonded interface is
already enabled\fR.  When no interfaces are enabled, then the first
bond interface to come up is enabled immediately\fR.
.IP "\fBbond_downdelay\fR: integer"
The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay down on an
interface before the interface is considered to be down\fR.  Specify
\fB0\fR to disable the interface immediately\fR.
.ST "LACP Configuration:"
LACP, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE standard that
allows switches to automatically detect that they are connected by
multiple links and aggregate across those links\fR.  These settings
control LACP behavior\fR.
.IP "\fBlacp\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\fR, \fBpassive\fR, or \fBoff\fR"
Configures LACP on this port\fR.  LACP allows directly connected
switches to negotiate which links may be bonded\fR.  LACP may be enabled
on non-bonded ports for the benefit of any switches they may be
connected to\fR.  \fBactive\fR ports are allowed to initiate LACP
negotiations\fR.  \fBpassive\fR ports are allowed to participate
in LACP negotiations initiated by a remote switch, but not allowed to
initiate such negotiations themselves\fR.  If LACP is enabled on a port
whose partner switch does not support LACP, the bond will be
disabled, unless other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is set to true\fR.
Defaults to \fBoff\fR if unset\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-system-id\fR: optional string"
The LACP system ID of this \fBPort\fR\fR.  The system ID of a
LACP bond is used to identify itself to its partners\fR.  Must be a
nonzero MAC address\fR. Defaults to the bridge Ethernet address if
unset\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-system-priority\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 65,535"
The LACP system priority of this \fBPort\fR\fR.  In LACP
negotiations, link status decisions are made by the system with the
numerically lower priority\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-time\fR: optional string, either \fBslow\fR or \fBfast\fR"
The LACP timing which should be used on this \fBPort\fR\fR.
By default \fBslow\fR is used\fR.  When configured to be
\fBfast\fR LACP heartbeats are requested at a rate of once
per second causing connectivity problems to be detected more
quickly\fR.  In \fBslow\fR mode, heartbeats are requested at a
rate of once every 30 seconds\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-fallback-ab\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Determines the behavior of openvswitch bond in LACP mode\fR. If
the partner switch does not support LACP, setting this option
to \fBtrue\fR allows openvswitch to fallback to
active-backup\fR. If the option is set to \fBfalse\fR, the
bond will be disabled\fR. In both the cases, once the partner switch
is configured to LACP mode, the bond will use LACP\fR.
.ST "Rebalancing Configuration:"
These settings control behavior when a bond is in
\fBbalance\-slb\fR or \fBbalance\-tcp\fR mode\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-rebalance-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 10,000"
For a load balanced bonded port, the number of milliseconds between
successive attempts to rebalance the bond, that is, to move flows
from one interface on the bond to another in an attempt to keep usage
of each interface roughly equal\fR.  If zero, load balancing is disabled
on the bond (link failure still cause flows to move)\fR.  If
less than 1000ms, the rebalance interval will be 1000ms\fR.
.IP "\fBbond_fake_iface\fR: boolean"
For a bonded port, whether to create a fake internal interface with the
name of the port\fR.  Use only for compatibility with legacy software that
requires this\fR.
.ST "Spanning Tree Protocol:"
The configuration here is only meaningful, and the status is only
populated, when 802\fR.1D\-1998 Spanning Tree Protocol is enabled on the
port\(cqs \fBBridge\fR with its \fBstp_enable\fR
column\fR.
.ST "STP Configuration:"

When STP is enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default on all of
the bridge\(cqs ports except bond, internal, and mirror ports (which do
not work with STP)\fR.  If this column\(cqs value is \fBfalse\fR,
STP is disabled on the port\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : stp-port-num\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 255"
The port number used for the lower 8 bits of the port-id\fR.  By
default, the numbers will be assigned automatically\fR.  If any

.ST "RSTP Configuration:"
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-enable\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When RSTP is enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default on all of
the bridge\(cqs ports except bond, internal, and mirror ports (which do
not work with RSTP)\fR.  If this column\(cqs value is \fBfalse\fR,
RSTP is disabled on the port\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-priority\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 240"
The port\(cqs relative priority value for determining the root port, in
multiples of 16\fR.  By default, the port priority is 0x80 (128)\fR.  Any
value in the lower 4 bits is rounded off\fR.  The significant upper 4
bits become the upper 4 bits of the port-id\fR.  A port with the lowest
port-id is elected as the root\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-num\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
The local RSTP port number, used as the lower 12 bits of the port-id\fR.
By default the port numbers are assigned automatically, and typically

.IP "\fBname\fR: immutable string (must be unique within table)"
Interface name\fR.  Should be alphanumeric and no more than about 8 bytes

otherwise be unique among the names of ports, interfaces, and bridges
on a host\fR.
.IP "\fBifindex\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295"
A positive interface index as defined for SNMP MIB-II in RFCs 1213 and
2863, if the interface has one, otherwise 0\fR.  The ifindex is useful for
seamless integration with protocols such as SNMP and sFlow\fR.
.IP "\fBmac_in_use\fR: optional string"
The MAC address in use by this interface\fR.
.IP "\fBmac\fR: optional string"
Ethernet address to set for this interface\fR.  If unset then the
default MAC address is used:
.RS
.IP \(bu
For the local interface, the default is the lowest-numbered MAC
address among the other bridge ports, either the value of the
\fBmac\fR in its \fBPort\fR record,
if set, or its actual MAC (for bonded ports, the MAC of its slave
whose name is first in alphabetical order)\fR.  Internal ports and
bridge ports that are used as port mirroring destinations (see the
\fBMirror\fR table) are ignored\fR.

External interfaces typically have a MAC address associated with
their hardware\fR.

Some interfaces may not have a software-controllable MAC

If the configuration of the port failed, as indicated by \-1 in \fBofport\fR, Open vSwitch sets this column to an error
description in human readable form\fR.  Otherwise, Open vSwitch clears
this column\fR.
.ST "OpenFlow Port Number:"
When a client adds a new interface, Open vSwitch chooses an OpenFlow
port number for the new port\fR.  If the client that adds the port fills
in \fBofport_request\fR, then Open vSwitch tries to use its
value as the OpenFlow port number\fR.  Otherwise, or if the requested
port number is already in use or cannot be used for another reason,
Open vSwitch automatically assigns a free port number\fR.  Regardless of
how the port number was obtained, Open vSwitch then reports in \fBofport\fR the port number actually assigned\fR.
.PP
Open vSwitch limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to
the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive\fR.  Controllers therefore have
free use of ports 32,768 and up\fR.
.IP "\fBofport\fR: optional integer"
OpenFlow port number for this interface\fR.  Open vSwitch sets this
column\(cqs value, so other clients should treat it as read-only\fR.
.IP
The OpenFlow ``local\(cq\(cq port (\fBOFPP_LOCAL\fR) is 65,534\fR.
The other valid port numbers are in the range 1 to 65,279,

.IP "\fBofport_request\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 65,279"
Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface\fR.
.IP
A client should ideally set this column\(cqs value in the same
database transaction that it uses to create the interface\fR.  Open
vSwitch version 2\fR.1 and later will honor a later request for a
specific port number, althuogh it might confuse some controllers:
OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number change, so
Open vSwitch represents it over OpenFlow as a port deletion
followed immediately by a port addition\fR.
.IP
If \fBofport_request\fR is set or changed to some other
port\(cqs automatically assigned port number, Open vSwitch chooses a
new port number for the latter port\fR.

.IP "\fBtype\fR: string"
The interface type\fR.  The types supported by a particular instance of
Open vSwitch are listed in the \fBiface_types\fR column in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR

.RS
.TP
\fBsystem\fR
An ordinary network device, e\fR.g\fR. \fBeth0\fR on Linux\fR.
Sometimes referred to as ``external interfaces\(cq\(cq since they are
generally connected to hardware external to that on which the Open
vSwitch is running\fR.  The empty string is a synonym for
\fBsystem\fR\fR.
.TP
\fBinternal\fR
A simulated network device that sends and receives traffic\fR.  An
internal interface whose \fBname\fR is the same as its
bridge\(cqs \fBname\fR is called the
``local interface\fR.\(cq\(cq  It does not make sense to bond an internal
interface, so the terms ``port\(cq\(cq and ``interface\(cq\(cq are often used
imprecisely for internal interfaces\fR.
.TP
\fBtap\fR
A TUN/TAP device managed by Open vSwitch\fR.
.TP
\fBgeneve\fR
An Ethernet over Geneve (\fBhttp://tools\fB.ietf\fB.org/html/draft\-gross\-geneve\-00\fR)
IPv4 tunnel\fR.
Geneve supports options as a means to transport additional metadata,
however, currently only the 24-bit VNI is supported\fR. This is planned
to be extended in the future\fR.
.TP
\fBgre\fR
An Ethernet over RFC 2890 Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4
tunnel\fR.
.TP
\fBipsec_gre\fR
An Ethernet over RFC 2890 Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4
IPsec tunnel\fR.
.TP
\fBgre64\fR
GRE64 tunnel protocol is deprecated and will be removed from OVS
v2\fR.5 release\fR.
It is same as GRE, but it allows 64 bit key\fR. To store higher 32-bits
of key, it uses GRE protocol sequence number field\fR. This is non
standard use of GRE protocol since OVS does not increment
sequence number for every packet at time of encap as expected by
standard GRE implementation\fR. See \fBTunnel Options\fR
for information on configuring GRE tunnels\fR.
.TP
\fBipsec_gre64\fR
GRE64 tunnel protocol is deprecated and will be removed from OVS
v2\fR.5 release\fR.
Same as IPSEC_GRE except 64 bit key\fR.
.TP
\fBvxlan\fR
An Ethernet tunnel over the UDP-based VXLAN protocol described in
RFC 7348\fR.
.IP
Open vSwitch uses UDP destination port 4789\fR.  The source port used for
VXLAN traffic varies on a per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral port
range\fR.
.TP
\fBlisp\fR
A layer 3 tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based Locator/ID
Separation Protocol (RFC 6830)\fR.
.IP
Only IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported by the protocol, and
they are sent and received without an Ethernet header\fR.  Traffic
to/from LISP ports is expected to be configured explicitly, and
the ports are not intended to participate in learning based
switching\fR.  As such, they are always excluded from packet
flooding\fR.
.TP
\fBstt\fR
The Stateless TCP Tunnel (STT) is particularly useful when tunnel
endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of
standard network interface cards to improve performance\fR.  STT utilizes
a TCP-like header inside the IP header\fR. It is stateless, i\fR.e\fR., there is
no TCP connection state of any kind associated with the tunnel\fR.  The
TCP-like header is used to leverage the capabilities of existing
network interface cards, but should not be interpreted as implying
any sort of connection state between endpoints\fR.
Since the STT protocol does not engage in the usual TCP 3-way handshake,
so it will have difficulty traversing stateful firewalls\fR.
The protocol is documented at
http://www\fR.ietf\fR.org/archive/id/draft-davie-stt\-06\fR.txt
All traffic uses a default destination port of 7471\fR. STT is only
available in kernel datapath on kernel 3\fR.5 or newer\fR.

implementation uses a simple ``token bucket\(cq\(cq approach:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The size of the bucket corresponds to \fBingress_policing_burst\fR\fR.  Initially the bucket is full\fR.
.IP \(bu
Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted to tokens) is
compared to the number of tokens currently in the bucket\fR.  If the
required number of tokens are available, they are removed and the
packet is forwarded\fR.  Otherwise, the packet is dropped\fR.
.IP \(bu
Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with tokens at the
rate specified by \fBingress_policing_rate\fR\fR.
.RE
.PP
Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and especially
with fragmented IP packets\fR.  Suppose that there is enough network
activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time\fR.  Then this token
bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the
period depending on packet size and on the configured rate\fR.  All of the
fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a
group\fR.  In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments
will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped\fR.  IP does not provide
any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining
fragments\fR.  In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what
will happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be
retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will
recur, or the sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped
and data will simply be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do)\fR.
Either way, it is possible that no forward progress will ever occur\fR.
.IP "\fBingress_policing_rate\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kbps\fR.  Data
received faster than this rate is dropped\fR.  Set to \fB0\fR
(the default) to disable policing\fR.
.IP "\fBingress_policing_burst\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in kb\fR.  The
default burst size if set to \fB0\fR is 1000 kb\fR.  This value
has no effect if \fBingress_policing_rate\fR
is \fB0\fR\fR.
.IP
Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more forgiving,
which is important for protocols like TCP that react severely to
dropped packets\fR.  The burst size should be at least the size of the
interface\(cqs MTU\fR.  Specifying a value that is numerically at least as
large as 10% of \fBingress_policing_rate\fR helps TCP come
closer to achieving the full rate\fR.
.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881, allows point-to-point
detection of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of
BFD control messages\fR.  Open vSwitch implements BFD to serve
as a more popular and standards compliant alternative to CFM\fR.
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a rate
negotiated independently in each direction\fR.  Each endpoint specifies
the rate at which it expects to receive control messages, and the rate
at which it is willing to transmit them\fR.  Open vSwitch uses a detection
multiplier of three, meaning that an endpoint signals a connectivity
fault if three consecutive BFD control messages fail to arrive\fR.  In the
case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the system not receiving
BFD control messages signals the problem to its peer in the messages it
transmits\fR.
.PP
The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply faithfully
with RFC 5880 requirements\fR.  Open vSwitch does not implement the
optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq features\fR.
.ST "BFD Configuration:"
A controller sets up key-value pairs in the \fBbfd\fR

choose to send messages at a slower rate\fR.  Defaults to
\fB1000\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd : min_tx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session is
willing to transmit BFD control messages\fR.  Messages will actually be
transmitted at a slower rate if the remote endpoint is not willing to
receive as quickly as specified\fR.  Defaults to \fB100\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd : decay_min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must be greater
than or equal to \fBbfd:min_rx\fR\fR.  The
implementation switches from \fBbfd:min_rx\fR to \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR when there is no obvious incoming
data traffic at the interface, to reduce the CPU and bandwidth cost
of monitoring an idle interface\fR.  This feature may be disabled by
setting a value of 0\fR.  This feature is reset whenever \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR or \fBbfd:min_rx\fR
changes\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd : forwarding_if_rx\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, traffic received on the
\fBInterface\fR is used to indicate the capability of packet
I/O\fR.  BFD control packets are still transmitted and received\fR.  At
least one BFD control packet must be received every 100 * \fBbfd:min_rx\fR amount of time\fR.  Otherwise, even if
traffic are received, the \fBbfd:forwarding\fR

.IP "\fBbfd : cpath_down\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should not be
forwarded to this system for some reason other than a connectivty
failure on the interface being monitored\fR.  The typical underlying
reason is ``concatenated path down,\(cq\(cq that is, that connectivity

Packets with different destination MAC will not be considered as BFD packets\fR.
If not specified the destination MAC address of received BFD packets

.ST "BFD Status:"
The switch sets key-value pairs in the \fBbfd_status\fR
column to report the status of BFD on this interface\fR.  When BFD is
not enabled, with \fBbfd:enable\fR, the switch clears
all key-value pairs from \fBbfd_status\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"
Reports the state of the BFD session\fR.  The BFD session is fully

.IP "\fBbfd_status : forwarding\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Reports whether the BFD session believes this \fBInterface\fR may be used to forward traffic\fR.  Typically this
means the local session is signaling \fBUP\fR, and the remote
system isn\(cqt signaling a problem such as concatenated path down\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : diagnostic\fR: optional string"
In case of a problem, set to an error message that reports what the
local BFD session thinks is wrong\fR.  The error messages are defined
in section 4\fR.1 of [RFC 5880]\fR.

.IP "\fBbfd_status : flap_count\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Counts the number of \fBbfd_status:forwarding\fR
flaps since start\fR.  A flap is considered as a change of the
\fBbfd_status:forwarding\fR value\fR.
.ST "Connectivity Fault Management:"
802\fR.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) allows a group of
Maintenance Points (MPs) called a Maintenance Association (MA) to
detect connectivity problems with each other\fR.  MPs within a MA should
have complete and exclusive interconnectivity\fR.  This is verified by
occasionally broadcasting Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) at a
configurable transmission interval\fR.
.PP
According to the 802\fR.1ag specification, each Maintenance Point should
be configured out-of-band with a list of Remote Maintenance Points it
should have connectivity to\fR.  Open vSwitch differs from the
specification in this area\fR.  It simply assumes the link is faulted if
no Remote Maintenance Points are reachable, and considers it not
faulted otherwise\fR.
.PP
When operating over tunnels which have no \fBin_key\fR, or an
\fBin_key\fR of \fBflow\fR\fR.  CFM will only accept CCMs
with a tunnel key of zero\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_mpid\fR: optional integer"
A Maintenance Point ID (MPID) uniquely identifies each endpoint
within a Maintenance Association\fR.  The MPID is used to identify this
endpoint to other Maintenance Points in the MA\fR.  Each end of a link
being monitored should have a different MPID\fR.  Must be configured to
enable CFM on this \fBInterface\fR\fR.
.IP
According to the 802\fR.1ag specification, MPIDs can only range between
[1, 8191]\fR.  However, extended mode (see \fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR) supports eight byte MPIDs\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_flap_count\fR: optional integer"
Counts the number of cfm fault flapps since boot\fR.  A flap is
considered to be a change of the \fBcfm_fault\fR value\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault\fR: optional boolean"
Indicates a connectivity fault triggered by an inability to receive
heartbeats from any remote endpoint\fR.  When a fault is triggered on
\fBInterface\fRs participating in bonds, they will be
disabled\fR.
.IP
Faults can be triggered for several reasons\fR.  Most importantly they
are triggered when no CCMs are received for a period of 3\fR.5 times the
transmission interval\fR. Faults are also triggered when any CCMs
indicate that a Remote Maintenance Point is not receiving CCMs but
able to send them\fR.  Finally, a fault is triggered if a CCM is
received which indicates unexpected configuration\fR.  Notably, this
case arises when a CCM is received which advertises the local MPID\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : recv\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to a lack of CCMs received on
the \fBInterface\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : rdi\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM with
the RDI bit flagged\fR.  Endpoints set the RDI bit in their CCMs when they
are not receiving CCMs themselves\fR.  This typically indicates a
unidirectional connectivity failure\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : maid\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM with
a MAID other than the one Open vSwitch uses\fR.  CFM broadcasts are tagged
with an identification number in addition to the MPID called the MAID\fR.
Open vSwitch only supports receiving CCM broadcasts tagged with the
MAID it uses internally\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : loopback\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM
advertising the same MPID configured in the \fBcfm_mpid\fR
column of this \fBInterface\fR\fR.  This may indicate a loop in
the network\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : overflow\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered because the CFM module received
CCMs from more remote endpoints than it can keep track of\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : override\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was manually triggered by an administrator using
an \fBovs\-appctl\fR command\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : interval\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM
frame having an invalid interval\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_opstate\fR: optional string, either \fBdown\fR or \fBup\fR"
When in extended mode, indicates the operational state of the
remote endpoint as either \fBup\fR or \fBdown\fR\fR.  See
\fBother_config:cfm_opstate\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_health\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 100"
Indicates the health of the interface as a percentage of CCM frames
received over 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs\fR.
The health of an interface is undefined if it is communicating with
more than one \fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR\fR.  It reduces if
healthy heartbeats are not received at the expected rate, and
gradually improves as healthy heartbeats are received at the desired
rate\fR. Every 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs, the
health of the interface is refreshed\fR.
.IP
As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for several reasons\fR.
The link health will deteriorate even if heartbeats are received but
they are reported to be unhealthy\fR.  An unhealthy heartbeat in this
context is a heartbeat for which either some fault is set or is out
of sequence\fR.  The interface health can be 100 only on receiving
healthy heartbeats at the desired rate\fR.
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR: set of integers"
When CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will occasionally
receive CCM broadcasts\fR.  These broadcasts contain the MPID of the
sending Maintenance Point\fR.  The list of MPIDs from which this
\fBInterface\fR is receiving broadcasts from is regularly
collected and written to this column\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The interval, in milliseconds, between transmissions of CFM
heartbeats\fR.  Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate a
connectivity fault\fR.
.IP
In standard operation only intervals of 3, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
60,000, or 600,000 ms are supported\fR.  Other values will be rounded
down to the nearest value on the list\fR.  Extended mode (see \fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR) supports any interval up
to 65,535 ms\fR.  In either mode, the default is 1000 ms\fR.
.IP
We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_extended\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, the CFM module operates in extended mode\fR. This
causes it to use a nonstandard destination address to avoid conflicting
with compliant implementations which may be running concurrently on the
network\fR. Furthermore, extended mode increases the accuracy of the
\fBcfm_interval\fR configuration parameter by breaking wire
compatibility with 802\fR.1ag compliant implementations\fR.  And extended
mode allows eight byte MPIDs\fR.  Defaults to \fBfalse\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_demand\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, and
\fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR is true, the CFM
module operates in demand mode\fR.  When in demand mode, traffic
received on the \fBInterface\fR is used to indicate
liveness\fR.  CCMs are still transmitted and received\fR.  At least one
CCM must be received every 100 * \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR amount of time\fR.  Otherwise, even if traffic
are received, the CFM module will raise the connectivity fault\fR.
.IP
Demand mode has a couple of caveats:
.RS
.IP \(bu
To ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull statistics
from the datapath, the fault detection interval is set to
3\fR.5 * MAX(\fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR, 500)
ms\fR.
.IP \(bu
To avoid ambiguity, demand mode disables itself when there are
multiple remote maintenance points\fR.
.IP \(bu
If the \fBInterface\fR is heavily congested, CCMs
containing the \fBother_config:cfm_opstate\fR
status may be dropped causing changes in the operational state to
be delayed\fR.  Similarly, if CCMs containing the RDI bit are not
received, unidirectional link failures may not be detected\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_opstate\fR: optional string, either \fBdown\fR or \fBup\fR"
When \fBdown\fR, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as
operationally down without triggering a fault\fR.  This allows remote
maintenance points to choose not to forward traffic to the
\fBInterface\fR on which this CFM module is running\fR.
Currently, in Open vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects
\fBInterface\fRs participating in bonds, and the bundle
OpenFlow action\fR. This setting is ignored when CFM is not in extended
mode\fR.  Defaults to \fBup\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_ccm_vlan\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 4,095"

When a flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict is
chosen through an approximation of the following algorithm:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Divide the flows in the table into groups based on the values of the
specified fields or subfields, so that all of the flows in a given
group have the same values for those fields\fR.  If a flow does not
specify a given field, that field\(cqs value is treated as 0\fR.
.IP 2. .25in
Consider the flows in the largest group, that is, the group that
contains the greatest number of flows\fR.  If two or more groups all
have the same largest number of flows, consider the flows in all of
those groups\fR.
.IP 3. .25in
Among the flows under consideration, choose the flow that expires
soonest for eviction\fR.
.RE
.IP
The eviction process only considers flows that have an idle timeout or
a hard timeout\fR.  That is, eviction never deletes permanent flows\fR.
(Permanent flows do count against \fBflow_limit\fR\fR.)
.IP
Open vSwitch ignores any invalid or unknown field specifications\fR.
.IP
When \fBoverflow_policy\fR is not \fBevict\fR, this
column has no effect\fR.
.IP "\fBprefixes\fR: set of up to 3 strings"
This string set specifies which fields should be used for
address prefix tracking\fR.  Prefix tracking allows the
classifier to skip rules with longer than necessary prefixes,
resulting in better wildcarding for datapath flows\fR.
.IP
Prefix tracking may be beneficial when a flow table contains
matches on IP address fields with different prefix lengths\fR.
For example, when a flow table contains IP address matches on
both full addresses and proper prefixes, the full address
matches will typically cause the datapath flow to un-wildcard
the whole address field (depending on flow entry priorities)\fR.
In this case each packet with a different address gets handed
to the userspace for flow processing and generates its own
datapath flow\fR.  With prefix tracking enabled for the address
field in question packets with addresses matching shorter
prefixes would generate datapath flows where the irrelevant
address bits are wildcarded, allowing the same datapath flow
to handle all the packets within the prefix in question\fR.  In
this case many userspace upcalls can be avoided and the
overall performance can be better\fR.
.IP
This is a performance optimization only, so packets will
receive the same treatment with or without prefix tracking\fR.
.IP
The supported fields are: \fBtun_id\fR,
\fBtun_src\fR, \fBtun_dst\fR,
\fBnw_src\fR, \fBnw_dst\fR (or aliases
\fBip_src\fR and \fBip_dst\fR),
\fBipv6_src\fR, and \fBipv6_dst\fR\fR.  (Using this
feature for \fBtun_id\fR would only make sense if the
tunnel IDs have prefix structure similar to IP addresses\fR.)
.IP
By default, the \fBprefixes=ip_dst,ip_src\fR are used
on each flow table\fR.  This instructs the flow classifier to
track the IP destination and source addresses used by the
rules in this specific flow table\fR.
.IP
The keyword \fBnone\fR is recognized as an explicit
override of the default values, causing no prefix fields to be
tracked\fR.
.IP
To set the prefix fields, the flow table record needs to
exist:
.RS
.TP
\fBovs\-vsctl set Bridge br0 flow_tables:0=@N1 \-\- \-\-id=@N1 create Flow_Table name=table0\fR
Creates a flow table record for the OpenFlow table number 0\fR.

\fBPlease note:\fR Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that

with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2,
connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received packets
into VLAN 123 on port 2\fR.  Suppose that the end host sends a packet on
port 1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2\fR.  The Open vSwitch
forwards this packet to its destination and then reflects it back on
port 2 in VLAN 123\fR.  This reflected packet causes the unmanaged
physical switch to replace the MAC learning table entry, which
correctly pointed to port 1, with one that incorrectly points to port
2\fR.  Afterward, the physical switch will direct packets destined for
the end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end
host on port 1, disrupting connectivity\fR.  If mirroring to a VLAN is
desired in this scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced
by one that learns Ethernet addresses on a per-VLAN basis\fR.  In
addition, learning should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored
traffic\fR. If this is not done then intermediate switches will learn
the MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traffic\fR.  If
packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored, then they will
be dropped since the switch will attempt to send them out the input
port\fR. Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to
correctly send the packet out all ports configured for that VLAN\fR.  If
Open vSwitch is being used as an intermediate switch, learning can be
disabled by adding the mirrored VLAN to \fBflood_vlans\fR

Primary controllers

Open vSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of primary
controllers\fR.  When multiple controllers are configured, Open
vSwitch connects to all of them simultaneously\fR.  Because

coordinate in interacting with a single switch, more than
one primary controller should be specified only if the
controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each
other\fR.  (The Nicira-defined \fBNXT_ROLE\fR OpenFlow
vendor extension may be useful for this\fR.)

Service controllers

.ST "Asynchronous Messages:"
OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers spontanenously,

asynchronous messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best use
of network resources\fR.
.IP "\fBenable_async_messages\fR: optional boolean"
The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at time of
connection establishment, which means that a controller can receive
asynchronous messages, potentially many of them, even if it turns them
off immediately after connecting\fR.  Set this column to
\fBfalse\fR to change Open vSwitch behavior to disable, by
default, all asynchronous messages\fR.  The controller can use the
\fBNXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG\fR Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn
on any messages that it does want to receive, if any\fR.
.ST "Controller Rate Limiting:"
A switch can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow
protocol\fR.  Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate can
overwhelm a controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow connection for
other purposes, increase the latency of flow setup, and use an
unreasonable amount of bandwidth\fR.  Therefore, Open vSwitch supports
limiting the rate of packet forwarding to a controller\fR.
.PP
There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to be sent to a
controller: either the packet ``misses\(cq\(cq in the flow table, that is,
there is no matching flow, or a flow table action says to send the
packet to the controller\fR.  Open vSwitch limits the rate of each kind
of packet separately at the configured rate\fR.  Therefore, the actual
rate that packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the
configured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons\fR.
.PP
This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow
connection\fR.  It is not general-purpose QoS\fR.  See the \fBQoS\fR table for quality of service configuration, and \fBingress_policing_rate\fR in the \fBInterface\fR table for ingress policing configuration\fR.
.IP "\fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 100"
The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the
OpenFlow controller, in packets per second\fR.  If no value is
specified, rate limiting is disabled\fR.
.IP "\fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 25"
When a high rate triggers rate-limiting, Open vSwitch queues
packets to the controller for each port and transmits them to the
controller at the configured rate\fR.  This value limits the number of
queued packets\fR.  Ports on a bridge share the packet queue fairly\fR.
.IP
This value has no effect unless \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR is configured\fR.  The current
default when this value is not specified is one-quarter of \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR, meaning that queuing can delay
forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms\fR.

.SH "IPFIX TABLE"
Configuration for sending packets to IPFIX collectors\fR.
.PP
IPFIX is a protocol that exports a number of details about flows\fR.  The
IPFIX implementation in Open vSwitch samples packets at a configurable
rate, extracts flow information from those packets, optionally caches and
aggregates the flow information, and sends the result to one or more
collectors\fR.
.PP
IPFIX in Open vSwitch can be configured two different ways:
.RS
.IP \(bu
With \fBper\-bridge sampling\fR, Open vSwitch performs IPFIX sampling
automatically on all packets that pass through a bridge\fR.  To configure
per-bridge sampling, create an \fBIPFIX\fR record and point a
\fBBridge\fR table\(cqs \fBipfix\fR
column to it\fR.  The \fBFlow_Sample_Collector_Set\fR table is
not used for per-bridge sampling\fR.
.IP \(bu
With \fBflow\-based sampling\fR, \fBsample\fR actions in the
OpenFlow flow table drive IPFIX sampling\fR.  See
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8) for a description of the
\fBsample\fR action\fR.
.IP
Flow-based sampling also requires database configuration: create a
\fBIPFIX\fR record that describes the IPFIX configuration
and a \fBFlow_Sample_Collector_Set\fR record that points to
the \fBBridge\fR whose flow table holds the
\fBsample\fR actions and to \fBIPFIX\fR record\fR.  The
\fBipfix\fR in the \fBBridge\fR
table is not used for flow-based sampling\fR.

.SH "AutoAttach TABLE"
Auto Attach configuration within a bridge\fR.  The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM
draft standard describes a compact method of using IEEE 802\fR.1AB Link
Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE 802\fR.1aq Shortest
Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices
to individual services in a SPB network\fR.  The intent here is to allow
network applications and devices using OVS to be able to easily take
advantage of features offered by industry standard SPB networks\fR.
.PP
Auto Attach (AA) uses LLDP to communicate between a directly connected
Auto Attach Client (AAC) and Auto Attach Server (AAS)\fR. The LLDP protocol
is extended to add two new Type-Length-Value tuples (TLVs)\fR. The first
new TLV supports the ongoing discovery of directly connected AA
correspondents\fR. Auto Attach operates by regularly transmitting AA
discovery TLVs between the AA client and AA server\fR. By exchanging these
discovery messages, both the AAC and AAS learn the system name and
system description of their peer\fR. In the OVS context, OVS operates as
the AA client and the AA server resides on a switch at the edge of the
SPB network\fR.
.PP
Once AA discovery has been completed the AAC then uses the
second new TLV to deliver identifier mappings from the AAC to the AAS\fR. A primary
feature of Auto Attach is to facilitate the mapping of VLANs defined
outside the SPB network onto service ids (ISIDs) defined within the SPM
network\fR. By doing so individual external VLANs can be mapped onto
specific SPB network services\fR. These VLAN id to ISID mappings can be
configured and managed locally using new options added to the ovs-vsctl
command\fR.
.PP
The Auto Attach OVS feature does not provide a full implementation of
the LLDP protocol\fR. Support for the mandatory TLVs as defined by the LLDP
standard and support for the AA TLV extensions is provided\fR. LLDP
protocol support in OVS can be enabled or disabled on a port by port
basis\fR. LLDP support is disabled by default\fR.
