NAME
       Open_vSwitch - Open_vSwitch database schema

       A  database  with  this  schema  holds  the  configuration for one Open
       vSwitch daemon.  The top-level configuration  for  the  daemon  is  the
       Open_vSwitch  table,  which  must  have exactly one record.  Records in
       other tables are significant only when they can be reached directly  or
       indirectly from the Open_vSwitch table.  Records that are not reachable
       from the Open_vSwitch table are automatically deleted  from  the  data‐
       base, except for records in a few distinguished ``root set’’ tables.

   Common Columns
       Most  tables contain two special columns, named other_config and exter‐
       nal_ids.  These columns have the same form and purpose each place  that
       they appear, so we describe them here to save space later.

              other_config: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value  pairs  for  configuring  rarely used features.
                     Supported keys, along with the forms taken by their  val‐
                     ues, are documented individually for each table.

                     A  few tables do not have other_config columns because no
                     key-value pairs have yet been defined for them.

              external_ids: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that inte‐
                     grate  with  Open  vSwitch,  rather  than by Open vSwitch
                     itself.  System integrators should either  use  the  Open
                     vSwitch  development mailing list to coordinate on common
                     key-value definitions,  or  choose  key  names  that  are
                     likely  to  be  unique.   In  some cases, where key-value
                     pairs have been defined that are likely to be widely use‐
                     ful, they are documented individually for each table.

         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
     Configuration:

       bridges: set of Bridges
              Set of bridges managed by the daemon.

       ssl: optional SSL
              SSL used globally by the daemon.

       external_ids : system-id: optional string
              A unique identifier for the Open vSwitch’s physical  host.   The
              form  of  the  identifier depends on the type of the host.  On a
              Citrix XenServer,  this  will  likely  be  the  same  as  exter‐
              nal_ids:xs-system-uuid.

       external_ids : xs-system-uuid: optional string
              The Citrix XenServer universally unique identifier for the phys‐
              ical host as displayed by xe host-list.

       other_config : stats-update-interval: optional  string,  containing  an
       integer, at least 5,000
              Interval  for  updating statistics to the database, in millisec‐
              onds.  This option will affect the update of the statistics col‐
              umn in the following tables: Port, Interface , Mirror.

              Default value is 5000 ms.

              Getting statistics more frequently can be achieved via OpenFlow.

       other_config : flow-restore-wait: optional string, either true or false
              When  ovs-vswitchd  starts  up,  it  has an empty flow table and
              therefore it handles all arriving packets in its default fashion
              according to its configuration, by dropping them or sending them
              to an OpenFlow controller or  switching  them  as  a  standalone
              switch.   This  behavior  is  ordinarily desirable.  However, if
              ovs-vswitchd is restarting as part of  a  ``hot-upgrade,’’  then
              this  leads to a relatively long period during which packets are
              mishandled.

              This option allows for improvement.   When  ovs-vswitchd  starts
              with  this  value  set  as true, it will neither flush or expire
              previously set datapath flows nor will it send and  receive  any
              packets  to  or from the datapath.  When this value is later set
              to false, ovs-vswitchd will start  receiving  packets  from  the
              datapath and re-setup the flows.

              Thus,  with  this  option,  the  procedure  for a hot-upgrade of
              ovs-vswitchd becomes roughly the following:

              1.
                Stop ovs-vswitchd.

              2.
                Set other_config:flow-restore-wait to true.

              3.
                Start ovs-vswitchd.

              4.
                Use ovs-ofctl (or some other program, such as an OpenFlow con‐
                troller)  to  restore  the  OpenFlow flow table to the desired
                state.

              5.
                Set other_config:flow-restore-wait  to  false  (or  remove  it
                entirely from the database).

              The  ovs-ctl’s  ``restart’’  and ``force-reload-kmod’’ functions
              use the above config option during hot upgrades.

       other_config : flow-limit: optional string, containing an  integer,  at
       least 0
              The  maximum number of flows allowed in the datapath flow table.
              Internally OVS will choose a flow limit  which  will  likely  be
              lower than this number, based on real time network conditions.

              The default is 200000.

       other_config  : n-dpdk-rxqs: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 1
              Specifies the number of rx queues to be created  for  each  dpdk
              interface.   If  not  specified  or specified to 0, one rx queue
              will be created for each dpdk interface by default.

       other_config : pmd-cpu-mask: optional string
              Specifies CPU mask for setting the cpu  affinity  of  PMD  (Poll
              Mode  Driver)  threads.   Value  should  be  in  the form of hex
              string, similar to the dpdk EAL ’-c COREMASK’  option  input  or
              the ’taskset’ mask input.

              The  lowest  order bit corresponds to the first CPU core.  A set
              bit means the corresponding core is available and a  pmd  thread
              will  be  created and pinned to it.  If the input does not cover
              all cores, those uncovered cores are considered not set.

              If not specified, one pmd thread will be created for  each  numa
              node  and  pinned  to  any  available  core  on the numa node by
              default.

       other_config : n-handler-threads: optional string, containing an  inte‐
       ger, at least 1
              Specifies  the  number  of threads for software datapaths to use
              for handling new flows.  The default the number  of  online  CPU
              cores minus the number of revalidators.

              This  configuration  is per datapath.  If you have more than one
              software datapath (e.g. some  system  bridges  and  some  netdev
              bridges),  then the total number of threads is n-handler-threads
              times the number of software datapaths.

       other_config : n-revalidator-threads: optional  string,  containing  an
       integer, at least 1
              Specifies  the  number  of threads for software datapaths to use
              for revalidating flows in the datapath.  Typically, there  is  a
              direct  correlation  between  the number of revalidator threads,
              and the number of flows allowed in the datapath.  The default is
              the  number  of  cpu  cores divided by four plus one.  If n-han‐
              dler-threads is set, the default changes to the  number  of  cpu
              cores minus the number of handler threads.

              This  configuration  is per datapath.  If you have more than one
              software datapath (e.g. some  system  bridges  and  some  netdev
              bridges),  then the total number of threads is n-handler-threads
              times the number of software datapaths.

     Status:

       next_cfg: integer
              Sequence number for client to increment.  When a client modifies
              any  part  of  the database configuration and wishes to wait for
              Open vSwitch to finish applying the changes,  it  may  increment
              this sequence number.

       cur_cfg: integer
              Sequence  number  that Open vSwitch sets to the current value of
              next_cfg after it  finishes  applying  a  set  of  configuration
              changes.

     Statistics:
       The  statistics  column contains key-value pairs that report statistics
       about a system running an Open vSwitch.  These are updated periodically
       (currently,  every  5  seconds).  Key-value pairs that cannot be deter‐
       mined or that do not apply to a platform are omitted.

       other_config : enable-statistics: optional string, either true or false
              Statistics are disabled by default to avoid overhead in the com‐
              mon  case  when  statistics  gathering  is not useful.  Set this
              value to true to enable populating the statistics column  or  to
              false to explicitly disable it.

       statistics : cpu: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              Number of CPU processors, threads, or cores currently online and
              available to the operating system on which Open vSwitch is  run‐
              ning,  as  an  integer.   This  may  be  less  than  the  number
              installed, if some are not online or if they are  not  available
              to the operating system.

              Open  vSwitch userspace processes are not multithreaded, but the
              Linux kernel-based datapath is.

       statistics : load_average: optional string
              A comma-separated list of three floating-point  numbers,  repre‐
              senting  the system load average over the last 1, 5, and 15 min‐
              utes, respectively.

       statistics : memory: optional string
              A comma-separated list of integers, each of which  represents  a
              quantity  of  memory  in  kilobytes that describes the operating
              system on which Open vSwitch is running.  In  respective  order,
              these values are:

              1.
                Total amount of RAM allocated to the OS.

              2.
                RAM allocated to the OS that is in use.

              3.
                RAM  that can be flushed out to disk or otherwise discarded if
                that space is needed for another purpose.  This number is nec‐
                essarily less than or equal to the previous value.

              4.
                Total disk space allocated for swap.

              5.
                Swap space currently in use.

              On  Linux,  all  five values can be determined and are included.
              On other operating systems, only the first  two  values  can  be
              determined, so the list will only have two values.

       statistics : process_NAME: optional string
              One  such  key-value pair, with NAME replaced by a process name,
              will exist for each running Open vSwitch  daemon  process,  with
              name  replaced by the daemon’s name (e.g. process_ovs-vswitchd).
              The value is a comma-separated list of integers.   The  integers
              represent  the  following, with memory measured in kilobytes and
              durations in milliseconds:

              1.
                The process’s virtual memory size.

              2.
                The process’s resident set size.

              3.
                The amount of  user  and  system  CPU  time  consumed  by  the
                process.

              4.
                The  number  of  times  that  the process has crashed and been
                automatically restarted by the monitor.

              5.
                The duration since the process was started.

              6.
                The duration for which the process has been running.

              The interpretation of some of these values  depends  on  whether
              the process was started with the --monitor.  If it was not, then
              the crash count will always be 0  and  the  two  durations  will
              always  be  the  same.   If  --monitor was given, then the crash
              count may be positive; if it is,  the  latter  duration  is  the
              amount of time since the most recent crash and restart.

              There will be one key-value pair for each file in Open vSwitch’s
              ``run directory’’ (usually /var/run/openvswitch) whose name ends
              in .pid, whose contents are a process ID, and which is locked by
              a running process.  The name is taken from the pidfile’s name.

              Currently Open vSwitch is only able to obtain all of  the  above
              detail  on  Linux systems.  On other systems, the same key-value
              pairs will be present but the values will always  be  the  empty
              string.

       statistics : file_systems: optional string
              A  space-separated  list  of information on local, writable file
              systems.  Each item in the list describes one  file  system  and
              consists in turn of a comma-separated list of the following:

              1.
                Mount  point, e.g. / or /var/log.  Any spaces or commas in the
                mount point are replaced by underscores.

              2.
                Total size, in kilobytes, as an integer.

              3.
                Amount of storage in use, in kilobytes, as an integer.

              This key-value pair is omitted if there are no  local,  writable
              file  systems or if Open vSwitch cannot obtain the needed infor‐
              mation.

     Version Reporting:
       These columns report the types and versions of the hardware  and  soft‐
       ware  running  Open  vSwitch.   We  recommend  in general that software
       should test whether specific features are supported instead of  relying
       on  version  number  checks.   These  values are primarily intended for
       reporting to human administrators.

       ovs_version: optional string
              The Open vSwitch version number, e.g. 1.1.0.

       db_version: optional string
              The   database   schema   version    number    in    the    form
              major.minor.tweak,  e.g. 1.2.3.  Whenever the database schema is
              changed in a non-backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column
              or  a table), major is incremented.  When the database schema is
              changed in a backward compatible way (e.g. adding a new column),
              minor  is incremented.  When the database schema is changed cos‐
              metically (e.g. reindenting its syntax), tweak is incremented.

              The schema version is part of the database  schema,  so  it  can
              also  be retrieved by fetching the schema using the Open vSwitch
              database protocol.

       system_type: optional string
              An identifier for the type  of  system  on  top  of  which  Open
              vSwitch runs, e.g. XenServer or KVM.

              System  integrators  are responsible for choosing and setting an
              appropriate value for this column.

       system_version: optional string
              The version  of  the  system  identified  by  system_type,  e.g.
              5.6.100-39265p on XenServer 5.6.100 build 39265.

              System  integrators  are responsible for choosing and setting an
              appropriate value for this column.

     Database Configuration:
       These  columns  primarily   configure   the   Open   vSwitch   database
       (ovsdb-server),  not the Open vSwitch switch (ovs-vswitchd).  The OVSDB
       database also uses the ssl settings.

       The Open vSwitch switch does read the database configuration to  deter‐
       mine remote IP addresses to which in-band control should apply.

       manager_options: set of Managers
              Database  clients  to  which  the  Open  vSwitch database server
              should connect or to which it should listen, along with  options
              for  how these connection should be configured.  See the Manager
              table for more information.

     Common Columns:
       The overall purpose of these columns is described under Common  Columns
       at the beginning of this document.

       other_config: map of string-string pairs

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs

Bridge TABLE
       Configuration for a bridge within an Open_vSwitch.

       A  Bridge  record  represents  an  Ethernet  switch  with  one  or more
       ``ports,’’ which are the Port records pointed to by the Bridge’s  ports
       column.

   Details:
     Core Features:

       name: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Bridge  identifier.   Should  be  alphanumeric  and no more than
              about 8 bytes long.  Must be unique among the  names  of  ports,
              interfaces, and bridges on a host.

       ports: set of Ports
              Ports included in the bridge.

       mirrors: set of Mirrors
              Port mirroring configuration.

       netflow: optional NetFlow
              NetFlow configuration.

       sflow: optional sFlow
              sFlow(R) configuration.

       ipfix: optional IPFIX
              IPFIX configuration.

       flood_vlans: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              VLAN  IDs  of VLANs on which MAC address learning should be dis‐
              abled, so that packets are flooded instead of being sent to spe‐
              cific  ports  that  are believed to contain packets’ destination
              MACs.  This should ordinarily be used to disable MAC learning on
              VLANs  used  for mirroring (RSPAN VLANs).  It may also be useful
              for debugging.

              SLB bonding (see the bond_mode column  in  the  Port  table)  is
              incompatible  with  flood_vlans.  Consider using another bonding
              mode or a different type of mirror instead.

     OpenFlow Configuration:

       controller: set of Controllers
              OpenFlow controller set.  If unset, then no OpenFlow controllers
              will be used.

              If  there  are  primary controllers, removing all of them clears
              the flow table.  If there are no primary controllers, adding one
              also  clears  the  flow table.  Other changes to the set of con‐
              trollers, such as  adding  or  removing  a  service  controller,
              adding another primary controller to supplement an existing pri‐
              mary controller, or  removing  only  one  of  two  primary  con‐
              trollers, have no effect on the flow table.

       flow_tables: map of integer-Flow_Table pairs, key in range 0 to 254
              Configuration for OpenFlow tables.  Each pair maps from an Open‐
              Flow table ID to configuration for that table.

       fail_mode: optional string, either secure or standalone
              When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily,  responsible
              for setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if the connection
              to the controller fails, no new network connections can  be  set
              up.  If the connection to the controller stays down long enough,
              no packets can pass through the switch  at  all.   This  setting
              determines the switch’s response to such a situation.  It may be
              set to one of the following:

              standalone
                     If no message is received from the controller  for  three
                     times   the   inactivity  probe  interval  (see  inactiv‐
                     ity_probe), then Open vSwitch will take over responsibil‐
                     ity  for  setting  up  flows.  In this mode, Open vSwitch
                     causes the bridge to act like  an  ordinary  MAC-learning
                     switch.   Open  vSwitch will continue to retry connecting
                     to the controller in the background and, when the connec‐
                     tion  succeeds, it will discontinue its standalone behav‐
                     ior.

              secure Open vSwitch will not set up flows on its  own  when  the
                     controller  connection  fails  or when no controllers are
                     defined.  The bridge will continue to retry connecting to
                     any defined controllers forever.

              The default is standalone if the value is unset, but future ver‐
              sions of Open vSwitch may change the default.

              The standalone mode can create forwarding loops on a bridge that
              has  more  than one uplink port unless STP is enabled.  To avoid
              loops on such a bridge, configure secure mode or enable STP (see
              stp_enable).

              When  more  than one controller is configured, fail_mode is con‐
              sidered only when none of the configured controllers can be con‐
              tacted.

              Changing  fail_mode  when  no primary controllers are configured
              clears the flow table.

       datapath_id: optional string
              Reports the OpenFlow datapath ID in use.  Exactly 16 hex digits.
              (Setting  this  column  has  no  useful  effect.  Set other-con‐
              fig:datapath-id instead.)

       datapath_version: string
              Reports the version number of the Open vSwitch datapath in  use.
              This  allows management software to detect and report discrepan‐
              cies between Open vSwitch userspace and datapath versions.  (The
              ovs_version  column in the Open_vSwitch reports the Open vSwitch
              userspace version.)  The version reported depends on  the  data‐
              path in use:

              ·      When  the  kernel  module  included  in  the Open vSwitch
                     source tree is used, this column reports the Open vSwitch
                     version from which the module was taken.

              ·      When the kernel module that is part of the upstream Linux
                     kernel is used, this column reports <unknown>.

              ·      When the datapath is built into the ovs-vswitchd  binary,
                     this  column  reports <built-in>.  A built-in datapath is
                     by definition the same version as the rest  of  the  Open
                     VSwitch userspace.

              ·      Other  datapaths  (such  as  the Hyper-V kernel datapath)
                     currently report <unknown>.

              A version discrepancy between ovs-vswitchd and the  datapath  in
              use  is  not  normally cause for alarm.  The Open vSwitch kernel
              datapaths for Linux and Hyper-V, in particular, are designed for
              maximum inter-version compatibility: any userspace version works
              with with any kernel version.  Some reasons do exist  to  insist
              on  particular  user/kernel  pairings.  First, newer kernel ver‐
              sions add new features, that can  only  be  used  by  new-enough
              userspace,   e.g.   VXLAN  tunneling  requires  certain  minimal
              userspace and kernel versions.  Second, as an extension  to  the
              first  reason,  some  newer kernel versions add new features for
              enhancing performance that only  new-enough  userspace  versions
              can take advantage of.

       other_config : datapath-id: optional string
              Exactly  16 hex digits to set the OpenFlow datapath ID to a spe‐
              cific value.  May not be all-zero.

       other_config : dp-desc: optional string
              Human readable description of datapath.  It  it  a  maximum  256
              byte-long  free-form  string to describe the datapath for debug‐
              ging purposes, e.g. switch3 in room 3120.

       other_config : disable-in-band: optional string, either true or false
              If set to true, disable in-band control on the bridge regardless
              of controller and manager settings.

       other_config  :  in-band-queue: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A queue ID as a nonnegative integer.   This  sets  the  OpenFlow
              queue ID that will be used by flows set up by in-band control on
              this bridge.  If unset, or if the port used by an  in-band  con‐
              trol  flow does not have QoS configured, or if the port does not
              have a queue with the specified ID, the default  queue  is  used
              instead.

       protocols:  set  of strings, one of OpenFlow11, OpenFlow10, OpenFlow13,
       OpenFlow12, OpenFlow15, or OpenFlow14
              List of OpenFlow protocols that may be used when  negotiating  a
              connection  with  a controller.  OpenFlow 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
              are enabled by default if this column is empty.

              OpenFlow 1.4 is not enabled by default because  its  implementa‐
              tion is missing features.

              OpenFlow  1.5 has the same risks as OpenFlow 1.4, but it is even
              more experimental because  the  OpenFlow  1.5  specification  is
              still  under  development  and  thus  subject  to  change.  Pass
              --enable-of15 to  ovs-vswitchd  to  allow  OpenFlow  1.5  to  be
              enabled.

       The IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that
       ensures loop-free topologies.  It allows redundant links to be included
       in  the  network  to provide automatic backup paths if the active links
       fails.

       stp_enable: boolean
              Enable spanning tree on the bridge.  By default, STP is disabled
              on  bridges.  Bond, internal, and mirror ports are not supported
              and will not participate in the spanning tree.

       other_config : stp-system-id: optional string
              The bridge’s STP identifier (the lower 48 bits of the bridge-id)
              in  the  form  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.  By default, the identifier is
              the MAC address of the bridge.

       other_config : stp-priority: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 65,535
              The  bridge’s  relative  priority value for determining the root
              bridge (the upper 16 bits of the bridge-id).  A bridge with  the
              lowest  bridge-id is elected the root.  By default, the priority
              is 0x8000.

       other_config : stp-hello-time: optional string, containing an  integer,
       in range 1 to 10
              The  interval  between transmissions of hello messages by desig‐
              nated ports, in seconds.  By default the  hello  interval  is  2
              seconds.

       other_config  : stp-max-age: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 6 to 40
              The maximum age of the information  transmitted  by  the  bridge
              when it is the root bridge, in seconds.  By default, the maximum
              age is 20 seconds.

       other_config : stp-forward-delay: optional string, containing an  inte‐
       ger, in range 4 to 30
              The  delay  to  wait  between  transitioning root and designated
              ports to forwarding, in seconds.   By  default,  the  forwarding
              delay is 15 seconds.

       other_config  :  mcast-snooping-aging-time: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 1
              The maximum number of seconds to  retain  a  multicast  snooping
              entry  for which no packets have been seen.  The default is cur‐
              rently 300 seconds (5 minutes).  The  value,  if  specified,  is
              forced into a reasonable range, currently 15 to 3600 seconds.

       other_config  :  mcast-snooping-table-size: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 1
              The maximum number of multicast  snooping  addresses  to  learn.
              The  default  is  currently  2048.   The value, if specified, is
              forced into a reasonable range, currently 10 to 1,000,000.

       other_config  :   mcast-snooping-disable-flood-unregistered:   optional
       string, either true or false
              If set to false, unregistered multicast packets are forwarded to
              all ports.  If set to true, unregistered multicast  packets  are
              forwarded to ports connected to multicast routers.

     Multicast Snooping Configuration:
       Multicast  snooping  (RFC  4541) monitors the Internet Group Management
       Protocol (IGMP) traffic  between  hosts  and  multicast  routers.   The
       switch uses what IGMP snooping learns to forward multicast traffic only
       to interfaces that are connected to interested receivers.  Currently it
       supports IGMPv1 and IGMPv2 protocols.

       mcast_snooping_enable: boolean
              Enable multicast snooping on the bridge. For now, the default is
              disabled.

     Rapid Spanning Tree Configuration:
       In IEEE Std 802.1D, 1998 Edition, and prior editions of this  standard,
       Clause 8 specified the spanning tree algorithm and protocol (STP).  STP
       has now been superseded by the  Rapid  Spanning  Tree  Protocol  (RSTP)
       specified  in Clause 17 of the IEEE Std 802.1D, 2004 Edition.  The IEEE
       802.1D-2004 Rapid Spanning Tree  Algorithm  Protocol  configures  full,
       simple, and symmetric connectivity throughout a Bridged Local Area Net‐
       work that comprises individual LANs interconnected  by  Bridges.   Like
       STP,  RSTP is a network protocol that ensures loop-free topologies.  It
       allows redundant links to be included in the network to  provide  auto‐
       matic backup paths if the active links fails.

       rstp_enable: boolean
              Enable  Rapid  Spanning Tree on the bridge.  By default, RSTP is
              disabled on bridges.  Bond, internal, and mirror ports  are  not
              supported and will not participate in the spanning tree.

       other_config : rstp-address: optional string
              The  bridge’s  RSTP address (the lower 48 bits of the bridge-id)
              in the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.  By default, the address  is  the
              MAC address of the bridge.

       other_config  :  rstp-priority: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 61,440
              The bridge’s relative priority value for  determining  the  root
              bridge  (the upper 16 bits of the bridge-id).  A bridge with the
              lowest bridge-id is elected the root.  By default, the  priority
              is  0x8000  (32768).  This value needs to be a multiple of 4096,
              otherwise it’s rounded to the nearest inferior one.

       other_config : rstp-ageing-time: optional string, containing  an  inte‐
       ger, in range 10 to 1,000,000
              The  Ageing Time parameter for the Bridge.  The default value is
              300 seconds.

       other_config : rstp-force-protocol-version: optional string, containing
       an integer
              The  Force  Protocol Version parameter for the Bridge.  This can
              take the value 0 (STP Compatibility mode)  or  2  (the  default,
              normal operation).

       other_config : rstp-max-age: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 6 to 40
              The maximum age of the information  transmitted  by  the  Bridge
              when it is the Root Bridge.  The default value is 20.

       other_config : rstp-forward-delay: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 4 to 30
              The delay used by STP Bridges to transition Root and  Designated
              Ports to Forwarding.  The default value is 15.

       other_config : rstp-transmit-hold-count: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 10
              The Transmit Hold Count used by the Port Transmit state  machine
              to limit transmission rate.  The default value is 6.

     Other Features:

       datapath_type: string
              Name of datapath provider.  The kernel datapath has type system.
              The userspace datapath has type netdev.

       external_ids : bridge-id: optional string
              A unique identifier of the bridge.   On  Citrix  XenServer  this
              will commonly be the same as external_ids:xs-network-uuids.

       external_ids : xs-network-uuids: optional string
              Semicolon-delimited  set of universally unique identifier(s) for
              the network with which this bridge is  associated  on  a  Citrix
              XenServer  host.   The network identifiers are RFC 4122 UUIDs as
              displayed by, e.g., xe network-list.

       other_config : hwaddr: optional string
              An Ethernet address in the form  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  to  set  the
              hardware  address  of  the local port and influence the datapath
              ID.

       other_config : forward-bpdu: optional string, either true or false
              Option to allow forwarding of BPDU frames when NORMAL action  is
              invoked.   Frames  with  reserved  Ethernet  addresses (e.g. STP
              BPDU) will be forwarded when this  option  is  enabled  and  the
              switch  is  not providing that functionality.  If STP is enabled
              on the port, STP BPDUs will never be  forwarded.   If  the  Open
              vSwitch  bridge  is used to connect different Ethernet networks,
              and if Open vSwitch node does not  run  STP,  then  this  option
              should  be enabled.  Default is disabled, set to true to enable.
              The following destination MAC addresss  will  not  be  forwarded
              when this option is enabled.

       other_config  : mac-aging-time: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 1
              The maximum number of seconds to retain a MAC learning entry for
              which  no  packets have been seen.  The default is currently 300
              seconds (5 minutes).  The value, if specified, is forced into  a
              reasonable range, currently 15 to 3600 seconds.

              A  short  MAC aging time allows a network to more quickly detect
              that a host is no longer connected to a switch  port.   However,
              it also makes it more likely that packets will be flooded unnec‐
              essarily, when they are  addressed  to  a  connected  host  that
              rarely  transmits  packets.  To reduce the incidence of unneces‐
              sary flooding, use a MAC aging  time  longer  than  the  maximum
              interval at which a host will ordinarily transmit packets.

       other_config  : mac-table-size: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 1
              The maximum number of MAC addresses to learn.   The  default  is
              currently  2048.  The value, if specified, is forced into a rea‐
              sonable range, currently 10 to 1,000,000.

Port TABLE
       A port within a Bridge.

       Most commonly, a port has exactly one ``interface,’’ pointed to by  its
       interfaces  column.   Such  a port logically corresponds to a port on a
       physical Ethernet switch.  A port with more than  one  interface  is  a
       ``bonded port’’ (see Bonding Configuration).

       Some  properties  that one might think as belonging to a port are actu‐
       ally part of the port’s Interface members.

   Summary:
       name                          immutable string (must be  unique  within
                                     table)

         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Port  name.   Should  be  alphanumeric  and no more than about 8
              bytes long.  May be the same as the  interface  name,  for  non-
              bonded  ports.   Must  otherwise  be  unique  among the names of
              ports, interfaces, and bridges on a host.

       interfaces: set of 1 or more Interfaces
              The port’s interfaces.  If there is more than  one,  this  is  a
              bonded Port.

     VLAN Configuration:
       Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:

              trunk  A  trunk  port  carries  packets on one or more specified
                     VLANs specified in the trunks  column  (often,  on  every
                     VLAN).  A packet that ingresses on a trunk port is in the
                     VLAN specified in its 802.1Q header, or  VLAN  0  if  the
                     packet  has  no  802.1Q  header.   A packet that egresses
                     through a trunk port will have an 802.1Q header if it has
                     a nonzero VLAN ID.

                     Any  packet  that ingresses on a trunk port tagged with a
                     VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped.

              access An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN speci‐
                     fied  in  the tag column.  Packets egressing on an access
                     port have no 802.1Q header.

                     Any packet with an 802.1Q header with a nonzero  VLAN  ID
                     that  ingresses  on an access port is dropped, regardless
                     of whether the VLAN ID in the header is the access port’s
                     VLAN ID.

              native-tagged
                     A  native-tagged  port  resembles  a trunk port, with the
                     exception that a packet without  an  802.1Q  header  that
                     ingresses  on  a  native-tagged  port  is in the ``native
                     VLAN’’ (specified in the tag column).

              native-untagged
                     A native-untagged port resembles  a  native-tagged  port,
                     with  the  exception  that  a  packet  that egresses on a
                     native-untagged port in the native VLAN will not have  an
                     802.1Q header.

       A  packet  will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of
       the packet, as described by the rules above.

       vlan_mode:   optional   string,   one   of    access,    native-tagged,
       native-untagged, or trunk
              The VLAN mode of the port, as described above.  When this column
              is empty, a default mode is selected as follows:

              ·      If tag contains a value, the port is an access port.  The
                     trunks column should be empty.

              ·      Otherwise,  the  port is a trunk port.  The trunks column
                     value is honored if it is present.

       tag: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095
              For an access port, the port’s implicitly tagged  VLAN.   For  a
              native-tagged  or  native-untagged port, the port’s native VLAN.
              Must be empty if this is a trunk port.

       trunks: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the  802.1Q
              VLAN  or  VLANs  that this port trunks; if it is empty, then the
              port trunks all VLANs.  Must be empty if this is an access port.

              A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its native
              VLAN, regardless of whether trunks includes that VLAN.

       other_config : priority-tags: optional string, either true or false
              An 802.1Q header contains two important pieces of information: a
              VLAN ID and a priority.  A frame with a zero VLAN ID,  called  a
              ``priority-tagged’’  frame,  is  supposed to be treated the same
              way as a frame without an 802.1Q header at all (except  for  the
              priority).

              However,  some network elements ignore any frame that has 802.1Q
              header at all, even when the VLAN ID  is  zero.   Therefore,  by
              default  Open  vSwitch  does  not output priority-tagged frames,
              instead omitting the 802.1Q header entirely if the  VLAN  ID  is
              zero.   Set this key to true to enable priority-tagged frames on
              a port.

              Regardless of this setting, Open vSwitch omits the 802.1Q header
              on output if both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero.

              All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero VLAN ID,
              so this setting is not meaningful on native-tagged ports.

     Bonding Configuration:
       A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded  port.’’  Bonding
       allows for load balancing and fail-over.

       The  following  types  of  bonding  will work with any kind of upstream
       switch.  On the upstream switch, do not configure the interfaces  as  a
       bond:

              balance-slb
                     Balances  flows  among slaves based on source MAC address
                     and output VLAN, with  periodic  rebalancing  as  traffic
                     patterns change.

              active-backup
                     Assigns  all flows to one slave, failing over to a backup
                     slave when the active slave is  disabled.   This  is  the
                     only bonding mode in which interfaces may be plugged into
                     different upstream switches.

       The following modes require the upstream switch to support 802.3ad with
       successful  LACP  negotiation. If LACP negotiation fails and other-con‐
       fig:lacp-fallback-ab is true, then active-backup mode is used:

              balance-tcp
                     Balances flows among slaves based on L2, L3, and L4  pro‐
                     tocol  information  such  as  destination MAC address, IP
                     address, and TCP port.

       These columns apply only to bonded ports.  Their values  are  otherwise
       ignored.

       bond_mode:  optional string, one of active-backup, balance-tcp, or bal‐
       ance-slb
              The type of  bonding  used  for  a  bonded  port.   Defaults  to
              active-backup if unset.

       other_config : bond-hash-basis: optional string, containing an integer
              An  integer  hashed along with flows when choosing output slaves
              in load  balanced  bonds.   When  changed,  all  flows  will  be
              assigned  different hash values possibly causing slave selection
              decisions to change.  Does not affect bonding modes which do not
              employ load balancing such as active-backup.

     Link Failure Detection:
       An  important  part of link bonding is detecting that links are down so
       that they may be disabled.  These settings determine how  Open  vSwitch
       detects link failure.

       other_config : bond-detect-mode: optional string, either miimon or car‐
       rier
              The means used to detect link  failures.   Defaults  to  carrier
              which  uses  each  interface’s carrier to detect failures.  When
              set to miimon, will check for failures by  polling  each  inter‐
              face’s MII.

       other_config  :  bond-miimon-interval:  optional  string, containing an
       integer
              The interval, in milliseconds, between  successive  attempts  to
              poll  each  interface’s  MII.   Relevant  only  when  other_con‐
              fig:bond-detect-mode is miimon.

       bond_updelay: integer
              The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay up on an
              interface  before the interface is considered to be up.  Specify
              0 to enable the interface immediately.

              This setting is honored only when at least one bonded  interface
              is  already  enabled.   When no interfaces are enabled, then the
              first bond interface to come up is enabled immediately.

       bond_downdelay: integer
              The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay down  on
              an  interface  before  the  interface  is considered to be down.
              Specify 0 to disable the interface immediately.

     LACP Configuration:
       LACP, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE  standard  that
       allows switches to automatically detect that they are connected by mul‐
       tiple links and aggregate across those links.  These  settings  control
       LACP behavior.

       lacp: optional string, one of active, passive, or off
              Configures  LACP  on  this port.  LACP allows directly connected
              switches to negotiate which links may be bonded.   LACP  may  be
              enabled on non-bonded ports for the benefit of any switches they
              may be connected to.  active ports are allowed to initiate  LACP
              negotiations.   passive ports are allowed to participate in LACP
              negotiations initiated by a remote switch, but  not  allowed  to
              initiate  such negotiations themselves.  If LACP is enabled on a
              port whose partner switch does not support LACP, the  bond  will
              be  disabled,  unless  other-config:lacp-fallback-ab  is  set to
              true.  Defaults to off if unset.

       other_config : lacp-system-id: optional string
              The LACP system ID of this Port.  The system ID of a  LACP  bond
              is  used  to identify itself to its partners.  Must be a nonzero
              MAC address. Defaults to the bridge Ethernet address if unset.

       other_config : lacp-system-priority:  optional  string,  containing  an
       integer, in range 1 to 65,535
              The  LACP  system  priority of this Port.  In LACP negotiations,
              link status decisions are made by the system  with  the  numeri‐
              cally lower priority.

       other_config : lacp-time: optional string, either slow or fast
              The  LACP  timing which should be used on this Port.  By default
              slow is used.  When configured to be fast  LACP  heartbeats  are
              requested  at  a  rate  of  once per second causing connectivity
              problems to be detected more quickly.  In slow mode,  heartbeats
              are requested at a rate of once every 30 seconds.

       other_config : lacp-fallback-ab: optional string, either true or false
              Determines the behavior of openvswitch bond in LACP mode. If the
              partner switch does not support LACP,  setting  this  option  to
              true  allows  openvswitch  to  fallback to active-backup. If the
              option is set to false, the bond will be disabled. In  both  the
              cases,  once  the partner switch is configured to LACP mode, the
              bond will use LACP.

     Rebalancing Configuration:
       These settings control behavior when a bond is in balance-slb  or  bal‐
       ance-tcp mode.

       other_config  : bond-rebalance-interval: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 10,000
              For a load balanced bonded  port,  the  number  of  milliseconds
              between  successive  attempts to rebalance the bond, that is, to
              move flows from one interface on  the  bond  to  another  in  an
              attempt to keep usage of each interface roughly equal.  If zero,
              load balancing is disabled on the bond (link failure still cause
              flows  to  move).   If  less than 1000ms, the rebalance interval
              will be 1000ms.

       bond_fake_iface: boolean
              For a bonded port, whether to create a fake  internal  interface
              with  the  name  of  the  port.  Use only for compatibility with
              legacy software that requires this.

     Spanning Tree Configuration:

       other_config : stp-enable: optional string, either true or false
              If spanning tree is enabled on  the  bridge,  member  ports  are
              enabled  by  default  (with the exception of bond, internal, and
              mirror ports which do not work  with  STP).   If  this  column’s
              value is false spanning tree is disabled on the port.

       other_config : stp-port-num: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 255
              The port number used for the lower 8 bits of  the  port-id.   By
              default,  the  numbers  will  be assigned automatically.  If any
              port’s number is manually configured on a bridge, then they must
              all be.

       other_config  : stp-port-priority: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 0 to 255
              The port’s relative priority value for determining the root port
              (the  upper 8 bits of the port-id).  A port with a lower port-id
              will be chosen as the root port.  By default,  the  priority  is
              0x80.

       other_config  :  stp-path-cost: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 65,535
              Spanning tree path cost for the port.  A lower number  indicates
              a  faster  link.   By  default, the cost is based on the maximum
              speed of the link.

     Rapid Spanning Tree Configuration:

       other_config : rstp-enable: optional string, either true or false
              If rapid spanning tree is enabled on the  bridge,  member  ports
              are  enabled  by  default (with the exception of bond, internal,
              and mirror ports which do not work with RSTP).  If this column’s
              value is false rapid spanning tree is disabled on the port.

       other_config : rstp-port-priority: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 0 to 240
              The port’s relative priority  value  for  determining  the  root
              port, in multiples of 16.  By default, the port priority is 0x80
              (128).  Any value in the lower 4 bits is rounded off.  The  sig‐
              nificant upper 4 bits become the upper 4 bits of the port-id.  A
              port with the lowest port-id is elected as the root.

       other_config : rstp-port-num: optional string, containing  an  integer,
       in range 1 to 4,095
              The  local  RSTP  port  number, used as the lower 12 bits of the
              port-id.  By default the port  numbers  are  assigned  automati‐
              cally,  and  typically  may  not correspond to the OpenFlow port
              numbers.  A port with the lowest port-id is elected as the root.

       other_config :  rstp-port-path-cost:  optional  string,  containing  an
       integer
              The  port  path  cost.   The Port’s contribution, when it is the
              Root Port, to the Root Path Cost for the Bridge.  By default the
              cost is automatically calculated from the port’s speed.

       other_config  :  rstp-port-admin-edge:  optional string, either true or
       false
              The admin edge port parameter for the Port.  Default is false.

       other_config : rstp-port-auto-edge: optional  string,  either  true  or
       false
              The auto edge port parameter for the Port.  Default is true.

       other_config : rstp-port-mcheck: optional string, either true or false
              The  mcheck port parameter for the Port.  Default is false.  May
              be set to force the Port Protocol  Migration  state  machine  to
              transmit RST BPDUs for a MigrateTime period, to test whether all
              STP Bridges on the attached LAN have been removed and  the  Port
              can  continue  to  transmit  RSTP  BPDUs.  Setting mcheck has no
              effect if the Bridge is operating in STP Compatibility mode.

              Changing the value from true to false has no effect,  but  needs
              to  be  done if this behavior is to be triggered again by subse‐
              quently changing the value from false to true.

     Multicast Snooping:

       other_config : mcast-snooping-flood: optional string,  either  true  or
       false
              If  set to true, multicast packets are unconditionally forwarded
              to the specific port.

     Other Features:

       qos: optional QoS
              Quality of Service configuration for this port.

       mac: optional string
              The MAC address to use for this port for the purpose of choosing
              the  bridge’s  MAC  address.   This  column does not necessarily
              reflect the port’s actual  MAC  address,  nor  will  setting  it
              change the port’s actual MAC address.

       fake_bridge: boolean
              Does this port represent a sub-bridge for its tagged VLAN within
              the Bridge?  See ovs-vsctl(8) for more information.

       external_ids : fake-bridge-id-*: optional string
              External IDs for a fake bridge (see the fake_bridge column)  are
              defined   by   prefixing   a   Bridge   external_ids   key  with
              fake-bridge-, e.g. fake-bridge-xs-network-uuids.

     Port Status:
       Status information about ports attached to bridges.

       status: map of string-string pairs
              Key-value pairs that report port status.

       status : stp_port_id: optional string
              The port-id (in hex) used in spanning  tree  advertisements  for
              this   port.   Configuring  the  port-id  is  described  in  the
              stp-port-num and stp-port-priority keys of the other_config sec‐
              tion earlier.

       status  :  stp_state:  optional  string,  one  of disabled, forwarding,
       learning, listening, or blocking
              STP state of the port.

       status : stp_sec_in_state: optional string, containing an  integer,  at
       least 0
              The amount of time (in seconds) port has been in the current STP
              state.

       status : stp_role: optional string, one of  designated,  alternate,  or
       root
              STP role of the port.

       status : bond_active_slave: optional string
              For  a bonded port, record the mac address of the current active
              slave.

     Port Statistics:
       Key-value pairs that report port statistics.  The update period is con‐
       trolled  by  other_config:stats-update-interval in the Open_vSwitch ta‐

     Core Features:

       name: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Interface name.  Should be alphanumeric and no more than about 8
              bytes long.  May be the same as the port  name,  for  non-bonded
              ports.   Must  otherwise  be  unique  among  the names of ports,
              interfaces, and bridges on a host.

       ifindex: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A positive interface index as defined for SNMP  MIB-II  in  RFCs
              1213  and  2863,  if  the  interface  has one, otherwise 0.  The
              ifindex is useful for seamless integration with  protocols  such
              as SNMP and sFlow.

       mac_in_use: optional string
              The MAC address in use by this interface.

       mac: optional string
              Ethernet  address  to set for this interface.  If unset then the
              default MAC address is used:

              ·      For the local interface, the default is  the  lowest-num‐
                     bered  MAC  address  among the other bridge ports, either
                     the value of the mac in its Port record, if set,  or  its
                     actual  MAC (for bonded ports, the MAC of its slave whose
                     name is first in alphabetical order).  Internal ports and
                     bridge ports that are used as port mirroring destinations
                     (see the Mirror table) are ignored.

              ·      For other internal interfaces, the default  MAC  is  ran‐
                     domly generated.

              ·      External  interfaces typically have a MAC address associ‐
                     ated with their hardware.

              Some  interfaces  may  not  have  a  software-controllable   MAC
              address.

       error: optional string
              If  the  configuration of the port failed, as indicated by -1 in
              ofport, Open vSwitch sets this column to an error description in
              human  readable  form.  Otherwise, Open vSwitch clears this col‐
              umn.

     OpenFlow Port Number:
       When a client adds a new interface, Open vSwitch  chooses  an  OpenFlow
       port  number  for the new port.  If the client that adds the port fills
       in ofport_request, then Open vSwitch tries to  use  its  value  as  the
       OpenFlow  port  number.   Otherwise, or if the requested port number is
       already in use or cannot be used for another reason, Open vSwitch auto‐
       matically  assigns a free port number.  Regardless of how the port num‐
       ber was obtained, Open vSwitch then reports in ofport the  port  number
       actually assigned.

       Open  vSwitch  limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to
       the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive.  Controllers therefore have free
       use of ports 32,768 and up.

       ofport: optional integer
              OpenFlow port number for this interface.  Open vSwitch sets this
              column’s value, so other clients should treat it as read-only.

              The OpenFlow ``local’’ port (OFPP_LOCAL) is 65,534.   The  other
              valid  port  numbers  are  in  the range 1 to 65,279, inclusive.
              Value -1 indicates an error adding the interface.

       ofport_request: optional integer, in range 1 to 65,279
              Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface.

              A client should ideally set this  column’s  value  in  the  same
              database transaction that it uses to create the interface.  Open
              vSwitch version 2.1 and later will honor a later request  for  a
              specific  port  number,  althuogh  it  might  confuse  some con‐
              trollers: OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number
              change,  so  Open  vSwitch represents it over OpenFlow as a port
              deletion followed immediately by a port addition.

              If ofport_request is set or changed to some other  port’s  auto‐
              matically  assigned port number, Open vSwitch chooses a new port
              number for the latter port.

     System-Specific Details:

       type: string
              The interface type, one of:

              system An ordinary network device, e.g. eth0  on  Linux.   Some‐
                     times  referred  to as ``external interfaces’’ since they
                     are generally connected to hardware external to  that  on
                     which the Open vSwitch is running.  The empty string is a
                     synonym for system.

              internal
                     A simulated network device that sends and receives  traf‐
                     fic.  An internal interface whose name is the same as its
                     bridge’s name is called the ``local interface.’’  It does
                     not  make  sense  to  bond  an internal interface, so the
                     terms ``port’’ and ``interface’’ are  often  used  impre‐
                     cisely for internal interfaces.

              tap    A TUN/TAP device managed by Open vSwitch.

              geneve An             Ethernet            over            Geneve
                     (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gross-geneve-00)   IPv4
                     tunnel.   Geneve supports options as a means to transport
                     additional metadata, however, currently only  the  24-bit
                     VNI  is  supported. This is planned to be extended in the
                     future.

              gre    An Ethernet over RFC 2890 Generic  Routing  Encapsulation
                     over IPv4 tunnel.

              ipsec_gre
                     An  Ethernet  over RFC 2890 Generic Routing Encapsulation
                     over IPv4 IPsec tunnel.

              gre64  It is same as GRE, but it allows 64  bit  key.  To  store
                     higher 32-bits of key, it uses GRE protocol sequence num‐
                     ber field. This is non standard use of GRE protocol since
                     OVS  does  not increment sequence number for every packet
                     at time of encap as expected by standard GRE  implementa‐
                     tion.  See  Tunnel Options for information on configuring
                     GRE tunnels.

              ipsec_gre64
                     Same as IPSEC_GRE except 64 bit key.

              vxlan  An Ethernet tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based VXLAN
                     protocol                   described                   at
                     http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-03.

                     Open  vSwitch uses UDP destination port 4789.  The source
                     port used for VXLAN traffic varies on  a  per-flow  basis
                     and is in the ephemeral port range.

              lisp   A  layer  3 tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based Loca‐
                     tor/ID Separation Protocol (RFC 6830).

                     Only IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported by the protocol,
                     and  they  are  sent  and  received  without  an Ethernet
                     header.  Traffic to/from LISP ports  is  expected  to  be
                     configured  explicitly, and the ports are not intended to
                     participate in learning based switching.  As  such,  they
                     are always excluded from packet flooding.

              null   An  ignored  interface. Deprecated and slated for removal
                     in February 2013.

     Tunnel Options:
       These options apply to interfaces with type of geneve, gre,  ipsec_gre,
       gre64, ipsec_gre64, vxlan, and lisp.

       Each  tunnel  must  be  uniquely identified by the combination of type,
       options:remote_ip, options:local_ip, and options:in_key.  If two  ports
       are defined that are the same except one has an optional identifier and
       the  other  does  not,  the  more  specific  one  is   matched   first.
       options:in_key  is  considered more specific than options:local_ip if a
       port defines one and another port defines the other.

       options : remote_ip: optional string
              Required.  The remote tunnel endpoint, one of:

              ·      An IPv4 address (not a  DNS  name),  e.g.  192.168.0.123.
                     Only unicast endpoints are supported.

              ·      The  word  flow.   The  tunnel  accepts  packets from any
                     remote tunnel endpoint.  To process only packets  from  a
                     specific  remote  tunnel  endpoint,  the flow entries may
                     match on the tun_src field.  When sending  packets  to  a
                     remote_ip=flow  tunnel,  the flow actions must explicitly
                     set the tun_dst field to the IP address  of  the  desired
                     remote tunnel endpoint, e.g. with a set_field action.

              The remote tunnel endpoint for any packet received from a tunnel
              is available in the tun_src field for matching in the  flow  ta‐
              ble.

       options : local_ip: optional string
              Optional.   The tunnel destination IP that received packets must
              match.  Default is to match all addresses.  If specified, may be
              one of:

              ·      An IPv4 address (not a DNS name), e.g. 192.168.12.3.

              ·      The word flow.  The tunnel accepts packets sent to any of
                     the local IP addresses of the  system  running  OVS.   To
                     process  only  packets sent to a specific IP address, the
                     flow entries may match on the tun_dst field.  When  send‐
                     ing  packets  to a local_ip=flow tunnel, the flow actions
                     may explicitly set the tun_src field to  the  desired  IP
                     address,  e.g.  with  a set_field action.  However, while
                     routing the tunneled packet out,  the  local  system  may
                     override  the specified address with the local IP address
                     configured for the outgoing system interface.

                     This option is valid only  for  tunnels  also  configured
                     with the remote_ip=flow option.

              The tunnel destination IP address for any packet received from a
              tunnel is available in the tun_dst field  for  matching  in  the
              flow table.

       options : in_key: optional string
              Optional.  The key that received packets must contain, one of:

              ·      0.  The tunnel receives packets with no key or with a key
                     of 0.  This is equivalent to specifying no options:in_key
                     at all.

              ·      A  positive  24-bit (for Geneve, VXLAN, and LISP), 32-bit
                     (for GRE) or  64-bit  (for  GRE64)  number.   The  tunnel
                     receives only packets with the specified key.

              ·      The  word flow.  The tunnel accepts packets with any key.
                     The key will be placed in the tun_id field  for  matching
                     in  the  flow  table.  The ovs-ofctl manual page contains
                     additional information about matching fields in  OpenFlow
                     flows.

       options : out_key: optional string
              Optional.  The key to be set on outgoing packets, one of:

              ·      0.   Packets  sent  through  the tunnel will have no key.
                     This is equivalent to specifying  no  options:out_key  at
                     all.

              ·      A  positive  24-bit  (for Geneve, VXLAN and LISP), 32-bit
                     (for GRE) or 64-bit (for  GRE64)  number.   Packets  sent
                     through the tunnel will have the specified key.

              ·      The word flow.  Packets sent through the tunnel will have
                     the key set using the set_tunnel Nicira  OpenFlow  vendor
                     extension  (0  is used in the absence of an action).  The
                     ovs-ofctl manual  page  contains  additional  information
                     about the Nicira OpenFlow vendor extensions.

       options : key: optional string
              Optional.  Shorthand to set in_key and out_key at the same time.

       options : tos: optional string
              Optional.   The  value of the ToS bits to be set on the encapsu‐
              lating packet.  ToS is interpreted as DSCP  and  ECN  bits,  ECN
              part  must  be  zero.  It may also be the word inherit, in which
              case the ToS will be copied from the inner packet if it is  IPv4
              or  IPv6  (otherwise  it  will be 0).  The ECN fields are always
              inherited.  Default is 0.

       options : ttl: optional string
              Optional.  The TTL to be set on the  encapsulating  packet.   It
              may  also  be  the  word  inherit, in which case the TTL will be
              copied from the inner packet if it is IPv4 or IPv6 (otherwise it
              will  be the system default, typically 64).  Default is the sys‐
              tem default TTL.

       options : df_default: optional string, either true or false
              Optional.  If enabled, the Don’t Fragment bit  will  be  set  on
              tunnel  outer  headers  to  allow path MTU discovery. Default is
              enabled; set to false to disable.

     Tunnel Options: gre and ipsec_gre only:
       Only gre and ipsec_gre interfaces support these options.

       options : csum: optional string, either true or false
              Optional.  Compute GRE checksums on outgoing  packets.   Default
              is disabled, set to true to enable.  Checksums present on incom‐
              ing packets will be validated regardless of this setting.

              GRE checksums impose a significant performance  penalty  because
              they  cover  the entire packet.  The encapsulated L3, L4, and L7
              packet contents typically have  their  own  checksums,  so  this
              additional checksum only adds value for the GRE and encapsulated
              L2 headers.

              This option is supported for ipsec_gre, but not  useful  because
              GRE checksums are weaker than, and redundant with, IPsec payload
              authentication.

     Tunnel Options: ipsec_gre only:
       Only ipsec_gre interfaces support these options.

       options : peer_cert: optional string
              Required for certificate authentication.   A  string  containing
              the  peer’s  certificate in PEM format.  Additionally the host’s
              certificate must be specified with the certificate option.

       options : certificate: optional string
              Required for certificate authentication.  The name of a PEM file
              containing a certificate that will be presented to the peer dur‐
              ing authentication.

       options : private_key: optional string
              Optional for certificate authentication.  The name of a PEM file
              containing the private key associated with certificate.  If cer‐
              tificate contains the private key, this option may be omitted.

       options : psk: optional string
              Required for pre-shared key authentication.   Specifies  a  pre-
              shared  key  for  authentication  that must be identical on both
              sides of the tunnel.

     Patch Options:
       Only patch interfaces support these options.

       options : peer: optional string
              The name of the Interface for the other side of the patch.   The
              named  Interface’s own peer option must specify this Interface’s
              name.  That is, the two patch interfaces must have reversed name
              and peer values.

     Interface Status:
       Status  information about interfaces attached to bridges, updated every
       5 seconds.  Not all interfaces have all of  these  properties;  virtual
       interfaces  don’t  have a link speed, for example.  Non-applicable col‐
       umns will have empty values.

       admin_state: optional string, either down or up
              The administrative state of the physical network link.

       link_state: optional string, either down or up
              The observed state of the physical network link.  This is  ordi‐
              narily  the link’s carrier status.  If the interface’s Port is a
              bond configured for miimon monitoring, it is instead the network
              link’s miimon status.

       link_resets: optional integer
              The  number of times Open vSwitch has observed the link_state of
              this Interface change.

       link_speed: optional integer
              The negotiated speed of the physical network link.  Valid values
              are positive integers greater than 0.

       duplex: optional string, either full or half
              The duplex mode of the physical network link.

       mtu: optional integer
              The  MTU (maximum transmission unit); i.e. the largest amount of
              data that can fit into a single Ethernet  frame.   The  standard
              Ethernet  MTU is 1500 bytes.  Some physical media and many kinds
              of virtual interfaces can be configured with higher MTUs.

              This column will be empty for an interface that does not have an
              MTU as, for example, some kinds of tunnels do not.

       lacp_current: optional boolean
              Boolean  value  indicating  LACP  status for this interface.  If
              true, this interface has current LACP information about its LACP
              partner.   This information may be used to monitor the health of
              interfaces in a LACP enabled port.  This column will be empty if
              LACP is not enabled.

       status: map of string-string pairs
              Key-value  pairs that report port status.  Supported status val‐
              ues are type-dependent; some interfaces may  not  have  a  valid
              status:driver_name, for example.

       status : driver_name: optional string
              The name of the device driver controlling the network adapter.

       status : driver_version: optional string
              The  version string of the device driver controlling the network
              adapter.

       status : firmware_version: optional string
              The version string of the network adapter’s firmware, if  avail‐
              able.

       status : source_ip: optional string
              The source IP address used for an IPv4 tunnel end-point, such as
              gre.

       status : tunnel_egress_iface: optional string
              Egress interface for tunnels.  Currently only relevant for  tun‐
              nels  on  Linux  systems,  this column will show the name of the
              interface which is responsible for routing traffic destined  for
              the  configured  options:remote_ip.   This  could be an internal
              interface such as a bridge port.

       status : tunnel_egress_iface_carrier: optional string, either  down  or
       up
              Whether carrier is detected on status:tunnel_egress_iface.

     Statistics:
       Key-value  pairs  that report interface statistics.  The current imple‐
       mentation updates these counters periodically.  The  update  period  is
       controlled  by  other_config:stats-update-interval  in the Open_vSwitch
       table.  Future implementations may update them  when  an  interface  is
       created,  when they are queried (e.g. using an OVSDB select operation),
       and just before an interface is deleted due to virtual  interface  hot-
       unplug or VM shutdown, and perhaps at other times, but not on any regu‐
       lar periodic basis.

       These are the same  statistics  reported  by  OpenFlow  in  its  struct
       ofp_port_stats  structure.   If  an  interface does not support a given
       statistic, then that pair is omitted.

     Statistics: Successful transmit and receive counters:

       statistics : rx_packets: optional integer
              Number of received packets.

       statistics : rx_bytes: optional integer
              Number of received bytes.

       statistics : tx_packets: optional integer
              Number of transmitted packets.

       statistics : tx_bytes: optional integer
              Number of transmitted bytes.

     Statistics: Receive errors:

       statistics : rx_dropped: optional integer
              Number of packets dropped by RX.

       statistics : rx_frame_err: optional integer
              Number of frame alignment errors.

       statistics : rx_over_err: optional integer
              Number of packets with RX overrun.

       statistics : rx_crc_err: optional integer
              Number of CRC errors.

       statistics : rx_errors: optional integer
              Total number of receive errors, greater than or equal to the sum
              of the above.

     Statistics: Transmit errors:

       statistics : tx_dropped: optional integer
              Number of packets dropped by TX.

       statistics : collisions: optional integer
              Number of collisions.

       statistics : tx_errors: optional integer
              Total  number  of  transmit errors, greater than or equal to the
              sum of the above.

     Ingress Policing:
       These settings control ingress policing for packets  received  on  this
       interface.   On  a  physical  interface,  this limits the rate at which
       traffic is allowed into the system  from  the  outside;  on  a  virtual
       interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at
       which the VM is able to transmit.

       Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops pack‐
       ets  received in excess of the configured rate.  Due to its simplicity,
       policing is usually less accurate and less effective  than  egress  QoS
       (which is configured using the QoS and Queue tables).

       Policing is currently implemented only on Linux.  The Linux implementa‐
       tion uses a simple ``token bucket’’ approach:

              ·      The size of  the  bucket  corresponds  to  ingress_polic‐
                     ing_burst.  Initially the bucket is full.

              ·      Whenever  a  packet  is  received, its size (converted to
                     tokens) is compared to the number of tokens currently  in
                     the  bucket.  If the required number of tokens are avail‐
                     able, they are removed and the packet is forwarded.  Oth‐
                     erwise, the packet is dropped.

              ·      Whenever  it  is  not  full,  the bucket is refilled with
                     tokens at the rate specified by ingress_policing_rate.

       Policing interacts badly with some network  protocols,  and  especially
       with  fragmented  IP  packets.   Suppose  that  there is enough network
       activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time.  Then this token
       bucket  algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the
       period depending on packet size and on the configured rate.  All of the
       fragments  of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a
       group.  In such a situation, therefore, only  one  of  these  fragments
       will  be  forwarded  and the rest will be dropped.  IP does not provide
       any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining  frag‐
       ments.  In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what will
       happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be retransmit‐
       ted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will recur, or the
       sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped and data  will
       simply  be  lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do).  Either way, it
       is possible that no forward progress will ever occur.

       ingress_policing_rate: integer, at least 0
              Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kbps.  Data
              received  faster  than  this  rate  is  dropped.   Set to 0 (the
              default) to disable policing.

       ingress_policing_burst: integer, at least 0
              Maximum burst size for data received on this interface,  in  kb.
              The  default  burst size if set to 0 is 1000 kb.  This value has
              no effect if ingress_policing_rate is 0.

              Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be  more  for‐
              giving, which is important for protocols like TCP that react se‐
              verely to dropped packets.  The burst size should  be  at  least
              the  size  of  the  interface’s MTU.  Specifying a value that is
              numerically at least as large as  10%  of  ingress_policing_rate
              helps TCP come closer to achieving the full rate.

     Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):
       BFD,  defined in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881, allows point-to-point detection
       of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control mes‐
       sages.   Open  vSwitch  implements  BFD  to serve as a more popular and
       standards compliant alternative to CFM.

       BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at  a  rate
       negotiated  independently  in  each direction.  Each endpoint specifies
       the rate at which it expects to receive control messages, and the  rate
       at which it is willing to transmit them.  Open vSwitch uses a detection
       multiplier of three, meaning that an endpoint  signals  a  connectivity
       fault if three consecutive BFD control messages fail to arrive.  In the
       case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the system  not  receiving
       BFD control messages signals the problem to its peer in the messages it
       transmits.

       The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply  faithfully  with
       RFC  5880  requirements.   Open vSwitch does not implement the optional
       Authentication or ``Echo Mode’’ features.

     BFD Configuration:
       A controller sets up key-value pairs in the bfd column  to  enable  and
       configure BFD.

       bfd : enable: optional string, either true or false
              True  to  enable  BFD  on this Interface.  If not specified, BFD
              will not be enabled by default.

       bfd : min_rx: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this  BFD  ses‐
              sion  offers  to  receive BFD control messages.  The remote end‐
              point may choose to send messages at a slower rate.  Defaults to
              1000.

       bfd : min_tx: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              The  shortest  interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD ses‐
              sion is willing to transmit BFD control messages.  Messages will
              actually  be transmitted at a slower rate if the remote endpoint
              is not willing to receive as quickly as specified.  Defaults  to
              100.

       bfd : decay_min_rx: optional string, containing an integer
              An  alternate  receive  interval,  in milliseconds, that must be
              greater  than  or  equal  to  bfd:min_rx.   The   implementation
              switches  from  bfd:min_rx  to bfd:decay_min_rx when there is no
              obvious incoming data traffic at the interface,  to  reduce  the
              CPU  and  bandwidth  cost of monitoring an idle interface.  This
              feature may be disabled by setting a value of 0.   This  feature
              is reset whenever bfd:decay_min_rx or bfd:min_rx changes.

       bfd : forwarding_if_rx: optional string, either true or false
              When true, traffic received on the Interface is used to indicate
              the capability of packet I/O.  BFD  control  packets  are  still
              transmitted  and received.  At least one BFD control packet must
              be received every 100 * bfd:min_rx amount of  time.   Otherwise,
              even if traffic are received, the bfd:forwarding will be false.

       bfd : cpath_down: optional string, either true or false
              Set  to  true  to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should
              not be forwarded to this system for some  reason  other  than  a
              connectivty failure on the interface being monitored.  The typi‐
              cal underlying reason is ``concatenated path  down,’’  that  is,
              that  connectivity beyond the local system is down.  Defaults to
              false.

       bfd : check_tnl_key: optional string, either true or false
              Set to true to make BFD accept only control messages with a tun‐
              nel  key of zero.  By default, BFD accepts control messages with
              any tunnel key.

       bfd : bfd_local_src_mac: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx to  set
              the MAC used as source for transmitted BFD packets.  The default
              is the mac address of the BFD enabled interface.

       bfd : bfd_local_dst_mac: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx to  set
              the  MAC  used  as destination for transmitted BFD packets.  The
              default is 00:23:20:00:00:01.

       bfd : bfd_remote_dst_mac: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx to  set
              the  MAC used for checking the destination of received BFD pack‐
              ets.  Packets with different destination MAC will not be consid‐
              ered  as  BFD  packets.   If  not  specified the destination MAC
              address of received BFD packets are not checked.

       bfd : bfd_src_ip: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as source  for
              transmitted BFD packets.  The default is 169.254.1.1.

       bfd : bfd_dst_ip: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as destination
              for transmitted BFD packets.  The default is 169.254.1.0.

     BFD Status:
       The switch sets key-value pairs in the bfd_status column to report  the
       status  of  BFD  on  this  interface.   When  BFD  is not enabled, with
       bfd:enable, the switch clears all key-value pairs from bfd_status.

       bfd_status :  state:  optional  string,  one  of  down,  init,  up,  or
       admin_down
              Reports  the state of the BFD session.  The BFD session is fully
              healthy and negotiated if UP.

       bfd_status : forwarding: optional string, either true or false
              Reports whether the BFD session believes this Interface  may  be
              used to forward traffic.  Typically this means the local session
              is signaling UP, and the remote system isn’t signaling a problem
              such as concatenated path down.

       bfd_status : diagnostic: optional string
              In  case of a problem, set to an error message that reports what
              the local BFD session thinks is wrong.  The error  messages  are
              defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       bfd_status  :  remote_state: optional string, one of down, init, up, or
       admin_down
              Reports the state of the remote endpoint’s BFD session.

       bfd_status : remote_diagnostic: optional string
              In case of a problem, set to an error message that reports  what
              the  remote  endpoint’s  BFD session thinks is wrong.  The error
              messages are defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       bfd_status : flap_count: optional string,  containing  an  integer,  at
       least 0
              Counts the number of bfd_status:forwarding flaps since start.  A
              flap is considered as  a  change  of  the  bfd_status:forwarding
              value.

     Connectivity Fault Management:
       802.1ag  Connectivity  Fault Management (CFM) allows a group of Mainte‐
       nance Points (MPs) called a Maintenance Association (MA) to detect con‐
       nectivity  problems  with each other.  MPs within a MA should have com‐
       plete and exclusive interconnectivity.  This is verified  by  occasion‐
       ally  broadcasting  Continuity  Check Messages (CCMs) at a configurable
       transmission interval.

       According to the 802.1ag specification, each Maintenance  Point  should
       be  configured  out-of-band with a list of Remote Maintenance Points it
       should have connectivity to.  Open vSwitch differs from the  specifica‐
       tion  in this area.  It simply assumes the link is faulted if no Remote
       Maintenance Points are reachable, and considers it not  faulted  other‐
       wise.

       When operating over tunnels which have no in_key, or an in_key of flow.
       CFM will only accept CCMs with a tunnel key of zero.

       cfm_mpid: optional integer
              A Maintenance Point ID (MPID) uniquely identifies each  endpoint
              within  a Maintenance Association.  The MPID is used to identify
              this endpoint to other Maintenance Points in the MA.   Each  end
              of a link being monitored should have a different MPID.  Must be
              configured to enable CFM on this Interface.

              According to the 802.1ag specification,  MPIDs  can  only  range
              between  [1,  8191].   However,  extended  mode  (see other_con‐
              fig:cfm_extended) supports eight byte MPIDs.

       cfm_flap_count: optional integer
              Counts the number of cfm fault flapps since  boot.   A  flap  is
              considered to be a change of the cfm_fault value.

       cfm_fault: optional boolean
              Indicates  a  connectivity  fault  triggered  by an inability to
              receive heartbeats from any remote endpoint.  When  a  fault  is
              triggered  on  Interfaces  participating  in bonds, they will be
              disabled.

              Faults can be triggered for several reasons.   Most  importantly
              they are triggered when no CCMs are received for a period of 3.5
              times the transmission interval. Faults are also triggered  when
              any CCMs indicate that a Remote Maintenance Point is not receiv‐
              ing CCMs but able to send them.  Finally, a fault  is  triggered
              if  a  CCM is received which indicates unexpected configuration.
              Notably, this case arises when a CCM is  received  which  adver‐
              tises the local MPID.

       cfm_fault_status : recv: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault  was  triggered  due  to a lack of CCMs
              received on the Interface.

       cfm_fault_status : rdi: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the  reception  of  a
              CCM  with  the  RDI  bit  flagged.  Endpoints set the RDI bit in
              their CCMs when they are not receiving  CCMs  themselves.   This
              typically indicates a unidirectional connectivity failure.

       cfm_fault_status : maid: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault was triggered due to the reception of a
              CCM with a MAID other than  the  one  Open  vSwitch  uses.   CFM
              broadcasts  are tagged with an identification number in addition
              to the MPID called the MAID.  Open vSwitch only supports receiv‐
              ing CCM broadcasts tagged with the MAID it uses internally.

       cfm_fault_status : loopback: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault was triggered due to the reception of a
              CCM advertising the same MPID configured in the cfm_mpid  column
              of this Interface.  This may indicate a loop in the network.

       cfm_fault_status : overflow: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault  was  triggered  because the CFM module
              received CCMs from more remote endpoints than it can keep  track
              of.

       cfm_fault_status : override: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was manually triggered by an administrator
              using an ovs-appctl command.

       cfm_fault_status : interval: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the  reception  of  a
              CCM frame having an invalid interval.

       cfm_remote_opstate: optional string, either down or up
              When  in  extended  mode, indicates the operational state of the
              remote  endpoint  as  either  up  or   down.    See   other_con‐
              fig:cfm_opstate.

       cfm_health: optional integer, in range 0 to 100
              Indicates  the  health  of  the interface as a percentage of CCM
              frames received over 21 other_config:cfm_intervals.  The  health
              of  an  interface  is undefined if it is communicating with more
              than one cfm_remote_mpids.  It reduces if healthy heartbeats are
              not  received  at  the  expected rate, and gradually improves as
              healthy heartbeats are received at the desired  rate.  Every  21
              other_config:cfm_intervals,  the  health  of  the  interface  is
              refreshed.

              As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for several rea‐
              sons.   The  link health will deteriorate even if heartbeats are
              received but they are reported to be  unhealthy.   An  unhealthy
              heartbeat  in  this context is a heartbeat for which either some
              fault is set or is out of sequence.  The interface health can be
              100 only on receiving healthy heartbeats at the desired rate.

       cfm_remote_mpids: set of integers
              When  CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will occasionally
              receive CCM broadcasts.  These broadcasts contain  the  MPID  of
              the  sending  Maintenance  Point.   The list of MPIDs from which
              this Interface is receiving broadcasts from  is  regularly  col‐
              lected and written to this column.

       other_config : cfm_interval: optional string, containing an integer
              The  interval,  in  milliseconds,  between  transmissions of CFM
              heartbeats.  Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate  a  con‐
              nectivity fault.

              In  standard  operation  only  intervals  of  3, 10, 100, 1,000,
              10,000, 60,000, or 600,000 ms are supported.  Other values  will
              be rounded down to the nearest value on the list.  Extended mode
              (see other_config:cfm_extended)  supports  any  interval  up  to
              65,535 ms.  In either mode, the default is 1000 ms.

              We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms.

       other_config : cfm_extended: optional string, either true or false
              When true, the CFM module operates in extended mode. This causes
              it to use a nonstandard destination address to avoid conflicting
              with compliant implementations which may be running concurrently
              on the network. Furthermore, extended mode increases  the  accu‐
              racy  of  the  cfm_interval  configuration parameter by breaking
              wire compatibility with 802.1ag compliant implementations.   And
              extended mode allows eight byte MPIDs.  Defaults to false.

       other_config : cfm_demand: optional string, either true or false
              When true, and other_config:cfm_extended is true, the CFM module
              operates in demand mode.  When in demand mode, traffic  received
              on  the  Interface is used to indicate liveness.  CCMs are still
              transmitted and received.  At least one  CCM  must  be  received
              every  100  *  other_config:cfm_interval amount of time.  Other‐
              wise, even if traffic are received, the CFM  module  will  raise
              the connectivity fault.

              Demand mode has a couple of caveats:

              ·      To  ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull sta‐
                     tistics from the datapath, the fault  detection  interval
                     is set to 3.5 * MAX(other_config:cfm_interval, 500) ms.

              ·      To  avoid  ambiguity,  demand  mode  disables itself when
                     there are multiple remote maintenance points.

              ·      If the Interface is heavily  congested,  CCMs  containing
                     the  other_config:cfm_opstate status may be dropped caus‐
                     ing changes in the operational state to be delayed.  Sim‐
                     ilarly,  if CCMs containing the RDI bit are not received,
                     unidirectional link failures may not be detected.

       other_config : cfm_opstate: optional string, either down or up
              When down, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as  opera‐
              tionally  down  without  triggering a fault.  This allows remote
              maintenance points to choose  not  to  forward  traffic  to  the
              Interface  on  which  this CFM module is running.  Currently, in
              Open vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects Interfaces partici‐
              pating in bonds, and the bundle OpenFlow action. This setting is
              ignored when CFM is not in extended mode.  Defaults to up.

       other_config : cfm_ccm_vlan: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 4,095
              When  set,  the  CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs it
              generates with the given value.  May be  the  string  random  in
              which  case  each  CCM  will be tagged with a different randomly
              generated VLAN.

       other_config : cfm_ccm_pcp: optional string, containing an integer,  in
       range 1 to 7
              When  set,  the  CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs it
              generates with the given PCP value, the VLAN ID of  the  tag  is
              governed   by   the   value   of  other_config:cfm_ccm_vlan.  If
              other_config:cfm_ccm_vlan is unset, a VLAN ID of zero is used.

     Bonding Configuration:

       other_config : lacp-port-id: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 65,535
              The  LACP  port ID of this Interface.  Port IDs are used in LACP
              negotiations to identify individual  ports  participating  in  a
              bond.

       other_config : lacp-port-priority: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 1 to 65,535
              The LACP port priority of this Interface.  In LACP  negotiations
              Interfaces  with  numerically lower priorities are preferred for
              aggregation.

       other_config : lacp-aggregation-key:  optional  string,  containing  an
       integer, in range 1 to 65,535
              The  LACP  aggregation  key  of this Interface.  Interfaces with
              different aggregation keys may not be active within a given Port
              at the same time.

     Virtual Machine Identifiers:
       These  key-value  pairs  specifically apply to an interface that repre‐
       sents a virtual Ethernet interface  connected  to  a  virtual  machine.
       These  key-value  pairs should not be present for other types of inter‐
       faces.  Keys whose names end in -uuid have values that  uniquely  iden‐
       tify  the entity in question.  For a Citrix XenServer hypervisor, these
       values are UUIDs in RFC 4122 format.  Other hypervisors may  use  other
       formats.

       external_ids : attached-mac: optional string
              The  MAC  address  programmed  into the ``virtual hardware’’ for
              this interface,  in  the  form  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.   For  Citrix
              XenServer,  this is the value of the MAC field in the VIF record
              for this interface.

       external_ids : iface-id: optional string
              A system-unique identifier for  the  interface.   On  XenServer,
              this will commonly be the same as external_ids:xs-vif-uuid.

       external_ids : iface-status: optional string, either active or inactive
              Hypervisors  may  sometimes have more than one interface associ‐
              ated with a given external_ids:iface-id, only one  of  which  is
              actually  in  use at a given time.  For example, in some circum‐
              stances XenServer has both a ``tap’’ and a ``vif’’ interface for
              a  single  external_ids:iface-id, but only uses one of them at a
              time.  A hypervisor that behaves this way  must  mark  the  cur‐
              rently  in  use  interface  active  and  the others inactive.  A
              hypervisor that never has more than one interface  for  a  given
              external_ids:iface-id  may  mark  that  interface active or omit
              external_ids:iface-status entirely.

              During VM migration, a given external_ids:iface-id  might  tran‐
              siently be marked active on two different hypervisors.  That is,
              active means  that  this  external_ids:iface-id  is  the  active
              instance  within  a  single  hypervisor, not in a broader scope.
              There is one exception: some hypervisors  support  ``migration’’
              from  a  given  hypervisor  to  itself (most often for test pur‐
              poses).  During such a ``migration,’’ two instances of a  single
              external_ids:iface-id  might  both be briefly marked active on a
              single hypervisor.

       external_ids : xs-vif-uuid: optional string
              The virtual interface associated with this interface.

       external_ids : xs-network-uuid: optional string
              The virtual network to which this interface is attached.

       external_ids : vm-id: optional string
              The VM to which this interface belongs. On XenServer, this  will
              be the same as external_ids:xs-vm-uuid.

       external_ids : xs-vm-uuid: optional string
              The VM to which this interface belongs.

     VLAN Splinters:
       The  ``VLAN  splinters’’  feature  increases Open vSwitch compatibility
       with buggy network drivers in old versions of Linux that do  not  prop‐
       erly support VLANs when VLAN devices are not used, at some cost in mem‐
       ory and performance.

       When VLAN splinters are enabled on a particular interface, Open vSwitch
       creates a VLAN device for each in-use VLAN.  For sending traffic tagged
       with a VLAN on the interface, it substitutes the VLAN device.   Traffic
       received  on  the  VLAN device is treated as if it had been received on
       the interface on the particular VLAN.

       VLAN splinters consider a VLAN to be in use if:

              ·      The VLAN is the tag value in any Port record.

              ·      The VLAN is listed within the trunks column of  the  Port
                     record  of  an  interface  on  which  VLAN  splinters are
                     enabled.  An empty trunks does not influence  the  in-use
                     VLANs: creating 4,096 VLAN devices is impractical because
                     it will exceed the current 1,024 port per datapath limit.

              ·      An OpenFlow flow within any bridge matches the VLAN.

       The same set of in-use VLANs applies to every interface on  which  VLAN
       splinters  are  enabled.  That is, the set is not chosen separately for
       each interface but selected once as the union of all in-use VLANs based
       on the rules above.

       It  does not make sense to enable VLAN splinters on an interface for an
       access port, or on an interface that is not a physical port.

       VLAN splinters are deprecated.   When  broken  device  drivers  are  no
       longer in widespread use, we will delete this feature.

       other_config  :  enable-vlan-splinters: optional string, either true or
       false
              Set  to  true  to  enable  VLAN  splinters  on  this  interface.
              Defaults to false.

              VLAN splinters increase kernel and userspace memory overhead, so
              do not use them unless they are needed.

              VLAN splinters do not support 802.1p  priority  tags.   Received
              priorities  will appear to be 0, regardless of their actual val‐
              ues, and priorities on transmitted packets will also be  cleared
              to 0.

Flow_Table TABLE
       Configuration for a particular OpenFlow table.

   Summary:
       name                          optional string
       flow_limit                    optional integer, at least 0
       overflow_policy               optional string, either refuse or evict
       groups                        set of strings
       prefixes                      set of up to 3 strings
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: optional string
              The table’s name.  Set this column to change the name that  con‐
              trollers  will  receive when they request table statistics, e.g.
              ovs-ofctl dump-tables.  The name does not affect  switch  behav‐
              ior.

       flow_limit: optional integer, at least 0
              If  set, limits the number of flows that may be added to the ta‐
              ble.  Open vSwitch may limit the number of flows in a table  for
              other  reasons, e.g. due to hardware limitations or for resource
              availability or performance reasons.

       overflow_policy: optional string, either refuse or evict
              Controls the switch’s behavior when an OpenFlow flow table modi‐
              fication  request  would add flows in excess of flow_limit.  The
              supported values are:

              refuse Refuse to add the  flow  or  flows.   This  is  also  the
                     default policy when overflow_policy is unset.

              evict  Delete the flow that will expire soonest.  See groups for
                     details.

       groups: set of strings
              When overflow_policy is evict, this controls how flows are  cho‐
              sen  for  eviction  when  the  flow table would otherwise exceed
              flow_limit flows.  Its value is a set  of  NXM  fields  or  sub-
              fields,  each  of  which  takes  one  of  the  forms  field[] or
              field[start..end],   e.g.    NXM_OF_IN_PORT[].     Please    see
              nicira-ext.h for a complete list of NXM field names.

              When  a  flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict
              is chosen through an approximation of the following algorithm:

              1.
                Divide the flows in the table into groups based on the  values
                of the specified fields or subfields, so that all of the flows
                in a given group have the same values for those fields.  If  a
                flow  does  not  specify  a given field, that field’s value is
                treated as 0.

              2.
                Consider the flows in the largest group, that  is,  the  group
                that  contains  the  greatest number of flows.  If two or more
                groups all have the same largest number of flows, consider the
                flows in all of those groups.

              3.
                Among  the  flows  under  consideration,  choose the flow that
                expires soonest for eviction.

              The eviction process only considers  flows  that  have  an  idle
              timeout or a hard timeout.  That is, eviction never deletes per‐
              manent flows.  (Permanent flows do count against flow_limit.)

              Open vSwitch ignores any invalid  or  unknown  field  specifica‐
              tions.

              When overflow_policy is not evict, this column has no effect.

       prefixes: set of up to 3 strings
              This  string  set  specifies  which  fields  should  be used for
              address prefix tracking.  Prefix tracking allows the  classifier
              to  skip rules with longer than necessary prefixes, resulting in
              better wildcarding for datapath flows.

              Prefix tracking may be beneficial when  a  flow  table  contains
              matches on IP address fields with different prefix lengths.  For
              example, when a flow table contains IP address matches  on  both
              full  addresses  and  proper  prefixes, the full address matches
              will typically cause the datapath flow to un-wildcard the  whole
              address  field  (depending  on  flow entry priorities).  In this
              case each packet with a different address  gets  handed  to  the
              userspace  for  flow  processing  and generates its own datapath
              flow.  With prefix tracking enabled for  the  address  field  in
              question  packets with addresses matching shorter prefixes would
              generate datapath flows where the irrelevant  address  bits  are
              wildcarded,  allowing  the  same datapath flow to handle all the
              packets within the  prefix  in  question.   In  this  case  many
              userspace upcalls can be avoided and the overall performance can
              be better.

              This is a performance optimization only, so packets will receive
              the same treatment with or without prefix tracking.

              The  supported  fields  are:  tun_id,  tun_src, tun_dst, nw_src,
              nw_dst (or aliases ip_src and ip_dst), ipv6_src,  and  ipv6_dst.
              (Using this feature for tun_id would only make sense if the tun‐
              nel IDs have prefix structure similar to IP addresses.)

              By default, the prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src are used on each flow ta‐
              ble.   This instructs the flow classifier to track the IP desti‐
              nation and source addresses used by the rules in  this  specific
              flow table.

              The  keyword  none  is recognized as an explicit override of the
              default values, causing no prefix fields to be tracked.

              To set the prefix fields, the flow table record needs to exist:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 flow_tables:0=@N1  --  --id=@N1  create
              Flow_Table name=table0
                     Creates a flow table record for the OpenFlow table number
                     0.

              ovs-vsctl set Flow_Table table0 prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src
                     Enables prefix tracking for  IP  source  and  destination
                     address fields.

              There  is a maximum number of fields that can be enabled for any
              one flow table.  Currently this limit is 3.

   Details:
       type: string
              The  type  of  QoS to implement. The currently defined types are
              listed below:

              linux-htb
                     Linux ``hierarchy token  bucket’’  classifier.   See  tc-
                     htb(8)  (also  at  http://linux.die.net/man/8/tc-htb) and
                     the HTB  manual  (http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/man‐
                     ual/userg.htm)  for  information  on  how this classifier
                     works and how to configure it.

              linux-hfsc
                     Linux "Hierarchical Fair Service Curve" classifier.   See
                     http://linux-ip.net/articles/hfsc.en/  for information on
                     how this classifier works.

       queues: map of integer-Queue pairs, key in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A map from queue numbers to Queue records.  The supported  range
              of queue numbers depend on type.  The queue numbers are the same
              as the queue_id used in OpenFlow  in  struct  ofp_action_enqueue
              and other structures.

              Queue 0 is the ``default queue.’’  It is used by OpenFlow output
              actions when no specific queue has been set.  When no configura‐
              tion  for  queue 0 is present, it is automatically configured as
              if a Queue record with empty dscp and other_config  columns  had
              been  specified.   (Before version 1.6, Open vSwitch would leave
              queue 0 unconfigured in this case.   With  some  queuing  disci‐
              plines,  this  dropped  all  packets  destined  for  the default
              queue.)

     Configuration for linux-htb and linux-hfsc:
       The linux-htb and linux-hfsc classes support  the  following  key-value
       pair:

       other_config : max-rate: optional string, containing an integer
              Maximum  rate shared by all queued traffic, in bit/s.  Optional.
              If not specified, for physical interfaces, the  default  is  the
              link  rate.   For other interfaces or if the link rate cannot be
              determined, the default is currently 100 Mbps.

         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       dscp: optional integer, in range 0 to 63
              If  set, Open vSwitch will mark all traffic egressing this Queue
              with the given DSCP bits.  Traffic egressing the  default  Queue
              is only marked if it was explicitly selected as the Queue at the
              time the packet was output.  If unset, the DSCP bits of  traffic
              egressing this Queue will remain unchanged.

     Configuration for linux-htb QoS:
       QoS  type linux-htb may use queue_ids less than 61440.  It has the fol‐
       lowing key-value pairs defined.

       other_config : min-rate: optional string,  containing  an  integer,  at
       least 1
              Minimum guaranteed bandwidth, in bit/s.

       other_config  :  max-rate:  optional  string, containing an integer, at
       least 1
              Maximum allowed bandwidth, in bit/s.  Optional.   If  specified,
              the  queue’s  rate  will  not be allowed to exceed the specified
              value, even if excess bandwidth is available.   If  unspecified,
              defaults to no limit.

       other_config  : burst: optional string, containing an integer, at least
       1
              Burst size, in bits.  This is the maximum amount of  ``credits’’
              that  a  queue  can  accumulate  while  it  is  idle.  Optional.
              Details of the linux-htb implementation require a minimum  burst
              size, so a too-small burst will be silently ignored.

       other_config  :  priority:  optional  string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A queue with a smaller priority  will  receive  all  the  excess
              bandwidth  that  it  can  use before a queue with a larger value
              receives any.  Specific priority values  are  unimportant;  only
              relative ordering matters.  Defaults to 0 if unspecified.

     Configuration for linux-hfsc QoS:
       QoS type linux-hfsc may use queue_ids less than 61440.  It has the fol‐
       lowing key-value pairs defined.

       other_config : min-rate: optional string,  containing  an  integer,  at
       least 1
              Minimum guaranteed bandwidth, in bit/s.

       other_config  :  max-rate:  optional  string, containing an integer, at
       least 1
              Maximum allowed bandwidth, in bit/s.  Optional.   If  specified,
              the  queue’s  rate  will  not be allowed to exceed the specified
              value, even if excess bandwidth is available.   If  unspecified,
              defaults to no limit.

Mirror TABLE
       A port mirror within a Bridge.

       A port mirror configures a bridge to send selected  frames  to  special
       ``mirrored’’  ports, in addition to their normal destinations.  Mirror‐
       ing traffic may also be referred to as SPAN or RSPAN, depending on  how
       the mirrored traffic is sent.

   Summary:
       name                          string
       Selecting Packets for Mirroring:
         select_all                  boolean
         select_dst_port             set of weak reference to Ports
         select_src_port             set of weak reference to Ports
         select_vlan                 set  of  up to 4,096 integers, in range 0
                                     to 4,095
       Mirroring Destination Configuration:
         output_port                 optional weak reference to Port
         output_vlan                 optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
       Statistics: Mirror counters:
         statistics : tx_packets     optional integer
         statistics : tx_bytes       optional integer
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string
              Arbitrary identifier for the Mirror.

     Selecting Packets for Mirroring:
       To be selected for mirroring, a given packet must enter  or  leave  the
       bridge  through  a  selected  port  and  it  must also be in one of the
       selected VLANs.

       select_all: boolean
              If true, every packet arriving  or  departing  on  any  port  is
              selected for mirroring.

       select_dst_port: set of weak reference to Ports
              Ports on which departing packets are selected for mirroring.

       select_src_port: set of weak reference to Ports
              Ports on which arriving packets are selected for mirroring.

       select_vlan: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              VLANs on which packets are selected for mirroring.  An empty set
              selects packets on all VLANs.

     Mirroring Destination Configuration:
       These columns are mutually exclusive.  Exactly  one  of  them  must  be
       nonempty.

       output_port: optional weak reference to Port
              Output port for selected packets, if nonempty.

              Specifying  a  port  for mirror output reserves that port exclu‐
              sively for mirroring.  No frames other than those  selected  for
              mirroring via this column will be forwarded to the port, and any
              frames received on the port will be discarded.

              The output port may be  any  kind  of  port  supported  by  Open
              vSwitch.   It  may  be,  for example, a physical port (sometimes
              called SPAN) or a GRE tunnel.

       output_vlan: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              Output VLAN for selected packets, if nonempty.

              The frames will be sent out all ports that trunk output_vlan, as
              well  as  any ports with implicit VLAN output_vlan.  When a mir‐
              rored frame is sent out a trunk port, the frame’s VLAN tag  will
              be  set  to  output_vlan, replacing any existing tag; when it is
              sent out an implicit VLAN port, the frame will  not  be  tagged.
              This type of mirroring is sometimes called RSPAN.

              See  the  documentation  for  other_config:forward-bpdu  in  the
              Interface table for a list of destination  MAC  addresses  which
              will  not be mirrored to a VLAN to avoid confusing switches that
              interpret the protocols that they represent.

              Please note: Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that con‐
              tains unmanaged switches.  Consider an unmanaged physical switch
              with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host,  and  port  2,
              connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received pack‐
              ets into VLAN 123 on port 2.  Suppose that the end host sends  a
              packet  on  port  1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2.
              The Open vSwitch forwards this packet  to  its  destination  and
              then  reflects  it  back  on port 2 in VLAN 123.  This reflected
              packet causes the unmanaged physical switch to replace  the  MAC
              learning  table  entry,  which correctly pointed to port 1, with
              one that incorrectly points to port 2.  Afterward, the  physical
              switch will direct packets destined for the end host to the Open
              vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end host on  port  1,  dis‐
              rupting connectivity.  If mirroring to a VLAN is desired in this
              scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced by one  that
              learns  Ethernet  addresses  on  a per-VLAN basis.  In addition,
              learning should be disabled  on  the  VLAN  containing  mirrored
              traffic.  If  this  is  not done then intermediate switches will
              learn the MAC address of each end host from the  mirrored  traf‐
              fic.   If packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored,
              then they will be dropped since the switch will attempt to  send
              them  out  the  input port. Disabling learning for the VLAN will
              cause the switch to correctly send the packet out all ports con‐
              figured  for  that  VLAN.   If  Open vSwitch is being used as an
              intermediate switch, learning can be disabled by adding the mir‐
              rored  VLAN  to  flood_vlans  in the appropriate Bridge table or
              tables.

              Mirroring to a GRE tunnel has fewer caveats than mirroring to  a
              VLAN and should generally be preferred.

     Statistics: Mirror counters:
       Key-value  pairs  that  report mirror statistics.  The update period is
       controlled by other_config:stats-update-interval  in  the  Open_vSwitch
       table.

       statistics : tx_packets: optional integer
              Number of packets transmitted through this mirror.

       statistics : tx_bytes: optional integer
              Number of bytes transmitted through this mirror.

     Common Columns:
       The  overall purpose of these columns is described under Common Columns
       at the beginning of this document.

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs

Controller TABLE
       An OpenFlow controller.

       Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers:

              Primary controllers
                     This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow
                     1.0  specification.  Usually, a primary controller imple‐
                     ments a network policy by taking charge of  the  switch’s
                     flow table.

                     Open  vSwitch  initiates and maintains persistent connec‐
                     tions to primary  controllers,  retrying  the  connection
                     each time it fails or drops.  The fail_mode column in the
                     Bridge table applies to primary controllers.

                     Open vSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of  pri‐
                     mary  controllers.  When multiple controllers are config‐
                     ured, Open vSwitch connects to  all  of  them  simultane‐
                     ously.   Because OpenFlow 1.0 does not specify how multi‐
                     ple controllers coordinate in interacting with  a  single
                     switch, more than one primary controller should be speci‐
                     fied only if the controllers are themselves  designed  to
                     coordinate with each other.  (The Nicira-defined NXT_ROLE
                     OpenFlow vendor extension may be useful for this.)

              Service controllers
                     These  kinds  of  OpenFlow  controller  connections   are
                     intended for occasional support and maintenance use, e.g.
                     with ovs-ofctl.  Usually a  service  controller  connects
                     only  briefly  to  inspect  or  modify some of a switch’s
                     state.

                     Open vSwitch listens for incoming connections  from  ser‐
                     vice  controllers.  The service controllers initiate and,
                     if necessary, maintain the connections  from  their  end.
                     The  fail_mode  column in the Bridge table does not apply
                     to service controllers.

                     Open vSwitch supports configuring any number  of  service
                     controllers.

       The target determines the type of controller.

     Core Features:

       target: string
              Connection method for controller.

              The following connection methods  are  currently  supported  for
              primary controllers:

              ssl:ip[:port]
                     The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name).  The
                     ssl  column  in  the  Open_vSwitch  table must point to a
                     valid SSL configuration when this form is used.

                     If port is not specified, it currently defaults to  6633.
                     In  the future, the default will change to 6653, which is
                     the IANA-defined value.

                     SSL support is an optional feature  that  is  not  always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              tcp:ip[:port]
                     The specified TCP port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must be expressed as an IP  address  (not  a  DNS  name),
                     where  ip  can be IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If ip is an IPv6
                     address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g. tcp:[::1]:6632.

                     If port is not specified, it currently defaults to  6633.
                     In  the future, the default will change to 6653, which is
                     the IANA-defined value.

              The following connection methods  are  currently  supported  for
              service controllers:

              pssl:[port][:ip]
                     Listens  for  SSL  connections on the specified TCP port.
                     If ip, which must be expressed as an IP  address  (not  a
                     DNS  name), is specified, then connections are restricted
                     to the specified local IP address (either IPv4 or  IPv6).
                     If  ip  is  an  IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets,
                     e.g. pssl:6632:[::1].

                     If port is not specified, it currently defaults to  6633.
                     If  ip is not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but
                     not IPv6) addresses.  The ssl column in the  Open_vSwitch
                     table  must  point to a valid SSL configuration when this
                     form is used.

                     If port is not specified, it currently defaults to  6633.
                     In  the future, the default will change to 6653, which is
                     the IANA-defined value.

                     SSL support is an optional feature  that  is  not  always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              ptcp:[port][:ip]
                     Listens  for  connections  on the specified TCP port.  If
                     ip, which must be expressed as an IP address (not  a  DNS
                     name),  is  specified, then connections are restricted to
                     the specified local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6).  If
                     ip  is  an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g.
                     ptcp:6632:[::1]. If ip is not specified then  it  listens
                     only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6633.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6653, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

              When  multiple  controllers  are configured for a single bridge,
              the target values must be unique.  Duplicate target values yield
              unspecified results.

       connection_mode: optional string, either in-band or out-of-band
              If  it  is  specified, this setting must be one of the following
              strings that describes how Open vSwitch contacts  this  OpenFlow
              controller over the network:

              in-band
                     In  this mode, this controller’s OpenFlow traffic travels
                     over the bridge associated  with  the  controller.   With
                     this setting, Open vSwitch allows traffic to and from the
                     controller regardless of the  contents  of  the  OpenFlow
                     flow table.  (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never be able
                     to connect to the controller, because it did not  have  a
                     flow  to  enable it.)  This is the most common connection
                     mode because it is not necessary to maintain two indepen‐
                     dent networks.

              out-of-band
                     In  this  mode,  OpenFlow  traffic uses a control network
                     separate from the bridge associated with this controller,
                     that  is,  the bridge does not use any of its own network
                     devices to communicate with the controller.  The  control
                     network  must  be  configured separately, before or after
                     ovs-vswitchd is started.

              If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.

     Controller Failure Detection and Handling:

       max_backoff: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  to  wait  between  connection
              attempts.  Default is implementation-specific.

       inactivity_probe: optional integer
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  of idle time on connection to
              controller before sending an inactivity probe message.  If  Open
              vSwitch  does not communicate with the controller for the speci‐
              fied number of seconds, it will send a probe.  If a response  is
              not  received  for  the  same  additional  amount  of time, Open
              vSwitch assumes the connection has been broken and  attempts  to
              reconnect.   Default  is  implementation-specific.  A value of 0
              disables inactivity probes.

     Asynchronous Messages:
       OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers  spontanenously,
       that  is,  not  in  response to any request from the controller.  These
       messages are called ``asynchronous  messages.’’   These  columns  allow
       asynchronous  messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best use
       of network resources.

       enable_async_messages: optional boolean
              The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at  time  of
              connection  establishment,  which  means  that  a controller can
              receive asynchronous messages, potentially many of them, even if
              it turns them off immediately after connecting.  Set this column
              to false to change Open vSwitch behavior to disable, by default,
              all   asynchronous   messages.    The  controller  can  use  the
              NXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn on any
              messages that it does want to receive, if any.

     Controller Rate Limiting:
       A  switch  can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow proto‐
       col.  Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate  can  overwhelm  a
       controller,  frustrate  use  of  the OpenFlow connection for other pur‐
       poses, increase the latency of flow  setup,  and  use  an  unreasonable
       amount  of  bandwidth.   Therefore,  Open vSwitch supports limiting the
       rate of packet forwarding to a controller.

       There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to  be  sent  to  a
       controller:  either  the  packet ``misses’’ in the flow table, that is,
       there is no matching flow, or a flow table  action  says  to  send  the
       packet to the controller.  Open vSwitch limits the rate of each kind of
       packet separately at the configured rate.  Therefore, the  actual  rate
       that  packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the config‐
       ured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons.

       This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow connec‐
       tion.  It is not general-purpose QoS.  See the QoS table for quality of
       service configuration, and ingress_policing_rate in the Interface table
       for ingress policing configuration.

       controller_rate_limit: optional integer, at least 100
              The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the
              OpenFlow controller, in packets per  second.   If  no  value  is
              specified, rate limiting is disabled.

       controller_burst_limit: optional integer, at least 25
              When  a  high  rate  triggers rate-limiting, Open vSwitch queues
              packets to the controller for each port and  transmits  them  to
              the  controller  at  the configured rate.  This value limits the
              number of queued packets.  Ports on a bridge  share  the  packet
              queue fairly.

              This value has no effect unless controller_rate_limit is config‐
              ured.  The current default when this value is not  specified  is
              one-quarter  of  controller_rate_limit, meaning that queuing can
              delay forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms.

     Controller Rate Limiting Statistics:
       These values report the effects of rate  limiting.   Their  values  are
       relative  to  establishment  of the most recent OpenFlow connection, or
       since rate limiting was  enabled,  whichever  happened  more  recently.
       Each  consists  of  two values, one with TYPE replaced by miss for rate
       limiting flow table misses, and the other with TYPE replaced by  action
       for rate limiting packets sent by OpenFlow actions.

       These  statistics  are  reported  only when controller rate limiting is
       enabled.

       status : packet-in-TYPE-bypassed: optional string, containing an  inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number of packets sent directly to the controller, without queu‐
              ing, because the rate did not exceed the configured maximum.

       status : packet-in-TYPE-queued: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              Number of packets added to the queue to send later.

       status  :  packet-in-TYPE-dropped: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number of packets added to the queue that were later dropped due
              to overflow.  This value is less than or equal to status:packet-
              in-TYPE-queued.

       status : packet-in-TYPE-backlog: optional string, containing  an  inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number  of  packets  currently  queued.   The  other  statistics
              increase monotonically, but this one fluctuates  between  0  and
              the controller_burst_limit as conditions change.

     Additional In-Band Configuration:
       These  values  are considered only in in-band control mode (see connec‐
       tion_mode).

       When multiple controllers are configured  on  a  single  bridge,  there
       should be only one set of unique values in these columns.  If different
       values are set for these columns in different controllers,  the  effect
       is unspecified.

       local_ip: optional string
              The   IP   address   to   configure  on  the  local  port,  e.g.
              192.168.0.123.  If this value is unset, then  local_netmask  and
              local_gateway are ignored.

       local_netmask: optional string
              The   IP   netmask   to   configure  on  the  local  port,  e.g.
              255.255.255.0.  If local_ip is set but this value is unset, then
              the  default  is chosen based on whether the IP address is class
              A, B, or C.

       local_gateway: optional string
              The IP address of the gateway to configure on the local port, as
              a  string,  e.g.  192.168.0.1.   Leave this column unset if this
              network has no gateway.

     Controller Status:

       is_connected: boolean
              true if currently connected to this controller, false otherwise.

       role: optional string, one of slave, other, or master
              The level of authority this controller  has  on  the  associated
              bridge. Possible values are:

              other  Allows the controller access to all OpenFlow features.

              master Equivalent to other, except that there may be at most one
                     master controller at a time.  When a  controller  config‐
                     ures  itself as master, any existing master is demoted to
                     the slave role.

              slave  Allows the controller read-only access to  OpenFlow  fea‐
                     tures.   Attempts  to  modify  the  flow  table  will  be
                     rejected with an error.  Slave controllers do not receive
                     OFPT_PACKET_IN or OFPT_FLOW_REMOVED messages, but they do
                     receive OFPT_PORT_STATUS messages.

       status : last_error: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to  the  controller;  i.e. strerror(errno).  This key will exist
              only if an error has occurred.

       status : state: optional string, one of ACTIVE, VOID, CONNECTING, IDLE,
       or BACKOFF
              The state of the connection to the controller:

              VOID   Connection is disabled.

              BACKOFF
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              CONNECTING
                     Attempting to connect.

              ACTIVE Connected, remote host responsive.

              IDLE   Connection is idle.  Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These  values  may change in the future.  They are provided only
              for human consumption.

       status : sec_since_connect: optional string, containing an integer,  at
       least 0
              The  amount of time since this controller last successfully con‐
              nected to the switch (in seconds).  Value is empty if controller
              has never successfully connected.

       status  : sec_since_disconnect: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 1
              The amount of time since this controller last disconnected  from
              the  switch (in seconds). Value is empty if controller has never
              disconnected.

     Connection Parameters:
       Additional configuration for a connection between  the  controller  and
       the Open vSwitch.

       other_config : dscp: optional string, containing an integer
              The  Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified using
              6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP header. DSCP
              provides a mechanism to classify the network traffic and provide
              Quality of Service (QoS) on IP networks.  The DSCP value  speci‐
              fied  here  is used when establishing the connection between the
              controller and the Open vSwitch.  If no value  is  specified,  a
              default value of 48 is chosen.  Valid DSCP values must be in the
              range 0 to 63.

Manager TABLE
       Configuration  for  a  database  connection to an Open vSwitch database
       (OVSDB) client.

       This   table   primarily   configures   the   Open   vSwitch   database
       (ovsdb-server), not the Open vSwitch switch (ovs-vswitchd).  The switch
       does read the table to determine what connections should be treated  as
       in-band.

       The  Open vSwitch database server can initiate and maintain active con‐
       nections to remote clients.  It can also listen  for  database  connec‐
       tions.

   Details:
     Core Features:

       target: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection method for managers.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              ssl:ip[:port]
                     The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name).  The
                     ssl column in the Open_vSwitch  table  must  point  to  a
                     valid SSL configuration when this form is used.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6632.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6640, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

                     SSL  support  is  an  optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              tcp:ip[:port]
                     The specified TCP port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must  be  expressed  as  an  IP address (not a DNS name),
                     where ip can be IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If ip is  an  IPv6
                     address, wrap it in square brackets, e.g. tcp:[::1]:6632.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6632.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6640, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

              pssl:[port][:ip]
                     Listens  for  SSL  connections on the specified TCP port.
                     Specify 0 for  port  to  have  the  kernel  automatically
                     choose an available port.  If ip, which must be expressed
                     as an IP address (not a DNS  name),  is  specified,  then
                     connections  are  restricted  to  the  specified local IP
                     address (either IPv4 or IPv6 address).  If ip is an  IPv6
                     address,  wrap  in square brackets, e.g. pssl:6632:[::1].
                     If ip is not specified then it listens only on IPv4  (but
                     not  IPv6) addresses.  The ssl column in the Open_vSwitch
                     table must point to a valid SSL configuration  when  this
                     form is used.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6632.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6640, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

                     SSL  support  is  an  optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              ptcp:[port][:ip]
                     Listens for connections on the specified TCP port.  Spec‐
                     ify 0 for port to have the kernel automatically choose an
                     available port.  If ip, which must be expressed as an  IP
                     address  (not a DNS name), is specified, then connections
                     are restricted to the specified local IP address  (either
                     IPv4 or IPv6 address).  If ip is an IPv6 address, wrap it
                     in square brackets, e.g. ptcp:6632:[::1].  If ip  is  not
                     specified then it listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6632.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6640, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

              When multiple managers are configured, the target values must be
              unique.  Duplicate target values yield unspecified results.

       connection_mode: optional string, either in-band or out-of-band
              If it is specified, this setting must be one  of  the  following
              strings  that  describes  how  Open  vSwitch contacts this OVSDB
              client over the network:

              in-band
                     In this mode, this connection’s traffic  travels  over  a
                     bridge  managed by Open vSwitch.  With this setting, Open
                     vSwitch allows traffic to and from the client  regardless
                     of  the contents of the OpenFlow flow table.  (Otherwise,
                     Open vSwitch would  never  be  able  to  connect  to  the
                     client,  because  it  did  not have a flow to enable it.)
                     This is the most common connection mode because it is not
                     necessary to maintain two independent networks.

              out-of-band
                     In this mode, the client’s traffic uses a control network
                     separate from that managed by Open vSwitch, that is, Open
                     vSwitch  does  not  use any of its own network devices to
                     communicate with the client.  The control network must be
                     configured  separately,  before  or after ovs-vswitchd is
                     started.

              If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.

     Client Failure Detection and Handling:

       max_backoff: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  to  wait  between  connection
              attempts.  Default is implementation-specific.

       inactivity_probe: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the
              client before sending an  inactivity  probe  message.   If  Open
              vSwitch  does  not communicate with the client for the specified
              number of seconds, it will send a probe.  If a response  is  not
              received  for  the  same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch
              assumes the connection has been broken and  attempts  to  recon‐
              nect.   Default  is  implementation-specific.  A value of 0 dis‐
              ables inactivity probes.

     Status:

       is_connected: boolean
              true if currently connected to this manager, false otherwise.

       status : last_error: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to  the manager; i.e. strerror(errno).  This key will exist only
              if an error has occurred.

       status : state: optional string, one of ACTIVE, VOID, CONNECTING, IDLE,
       or BACKOFF
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              VOID   Connection is disabled.

              BACKOFF
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              CONNECTING
                     Attempting to connect.

              ACTIVE Connected, remote host responsive.

              IDLE   Connection is idle.  Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These  values  may change in the future.  They are provided only
              for human consumption.

       status : sec_since_connect: optional string, containing an integer,  at
       least 0
              The  amount  of  time  since this manager last successfully con‐
              nected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty  if  manager
              has never successfully connected.

       status  : sec_since_disconnect: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              The amount of time since this manager last disconnected from the
              database  (in seconds). Value is empty if manager has never dis‐
              connected.

       status : locks_held: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  holds.   Omitted  if  the  connection does not hold any
              locks.

       status : locks_waiting: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection is currently waiting to acquire.  Omitted if the connec‐
              tion is not waiting for any locks.

       status : locks_lost: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  has  had stolen by another OVSDB client.  Omitted if no
              locks have been stolen from this connection.

       status : n_connections: optional  string,  containing  an  integer,  at
       least 2
              When  target  specifies  a  connection  method  that listens for
              inbound connections (e.g. ptcp: or pssl:) and more than one con‐
              nection  is  actually  active, the value is the number of active
              connections.  Otherwise, this key-value pair is omitted.

              When multiple connections are active, status  columns  and  key-
              value pairs (other than this one) report the status of one arbi‐
              trarily chosen connection.

       status : bound_port: optional string, containing an integer
              When target is ptcp: or pssl:, this is the TCP port on which the
              OVSDB server is listening.  (This is is particularly useful when
              target specifies a port of 0, allowing the kernel to choose  any
              available port.)

     Connection Parameters:
       Additional  configuration  for a connection between the manager and the
       Open vSwitch Database.

       other_config : dscp: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified  using
              6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP header. DSCP
              provides a mechanism to classify the network traffic and provide
              Quality  of Service (QoS) on IP networks.  The DSCP value speci‐
              fied here is used when establishing the connection  between  the
              manager  and  the  Open  vSwitch.   If  no value is specified, a
              default value of 48 is chosen.  Valid DSCP values must be in the
              range 0 to 63.

       engine_id: optional integer, in range 0 to 255
              Engine ID to use in NetFlow messages.  The value used depends on
              the datapath in use.  Kernel-based datapaths use the ifindex  of
              the  datapath  device,  e.g. the ifindex of ovs-system (this can
              change from one boot to the next or even more often if the  Open
              vSwitch  kernel  module is unloaded and reloaded or if the data‐
              path is otherwise deleted).  The userspace datapath uses 8  bits
              of  an  internally  generated  hash  of the datapath name (for a
              given Open vSwitch architecture and  version,  this  is  a  con‐
              stant).

       engine_type: optional integer, in range 0 to 255
              Engine  type to use in NetFlow messages.  The value used depends
              on the datapath in use.  Kernel-based datapaths use the  ifindex
              of  the  datapath  device  (the  same  value  as engine_id.  The
              userspace datapath uses 8 bits of an internally  generated  hash
              of  the  datapath  name  (but  the  bits used are different from
              engine_id.

       active_timeout: integer, at least -1
              The interval at which NetFlow records are sent  for  flows  that
              are still active, in seconds.  A value of 0 requests the default
              timeout (currently 600 seconds); a value of -1  disables  active
              timeouts.

       add_id_to_interface: boolean
              If  this  column’s value is false, the ingress and egress inter‐
              face fields of NetFlow flow records are  derived  from  OpenFlow
              port  numbers.   When it is true, the 7 most significant bits of
              these fields will be replaced by the least significant 7 bits of
              the  engine  id.  This is useful because many NetFlow collectors
              do not expect multiple switches to be sending messages from  the
              same  host,  so  they  do not store the engine information which
              could be used to disambiguate the traffic.

              When this option is enabled, a maximum of  508  ports  are  sup‐
              ported.

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       private_key: string
              Name of a PEM file  containing  the  private  key  used  as  the
              switch’s identity for SSL connections to the controller.

       certificate: string
              Name  of a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the cer‐
              tificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager, that
              certifies  the  switch’s  private key, identifying a trustworthy
              switch.

       ca_cert: string
              Name of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to  verify
              that the switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.

       bootstrap_ca_cert: boolean
              If  set to true, then Open vSwitch will attempt to obtain the CA
              certificate from the controller on its first SSL connection  and
              save  it  to  the  named  PEM file. If it is successful, it will
              immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then  on
              all  SSL  connections  must  be  authenticated  by a certificate
              signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.  This option exposes
              the  SSL  connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the
              initial CA certificate.  It may still be useful  for  bootstrap‐
              ping.

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       agent: optional string
              Name  of  the network device whose IP address should be reported
              as the ``agent address’’ to collectors.  If not  specified,  the
              agent  device  is  figured from the first target address and the
              routing table.  If the routing table does not contain a route to
              the  target, the IP address defaults to the local_ip in the col‐
              lector’s Controller.  If an agent IP address  cannot  be  deter‐
              mined any of these ways, sFlow is disabled.

       header: optional integer
              Number  of  bytes  of a sampled packet to send to the collector.
              If not specified, the default is 128 bytes.

       polling: optional integer
              Polling rate in seconds to send port statistics to  the  collec‐
              tor.  If not specified, defaults to 30 seconds.

       sampling: optional integer
              Rate  at which packets should be sampled and sent to the collec‐
              tor.  If not specified, defaults to 400, which means one out  of
              400 packets, on average, will be sent to the collector.

       targets: set of 1 or more strings
              sFlow targets in the form ip:port.

IPFIX TABLE
       Configuration for sending packets to IPFIX collectors.

       IPFIX is a protocol that exports a number of details about flows.   The
       IPFIX  implementation in Open vSwitch samples packets at a configurable
       rate, extracts flow information from those packets,  optionally  caches
       and  aggregates  the  flow  information, and sends the result to one or
       more collectors.

       IPFIX in Open vSwitch can be configured two different ways:

              ·      With per-bridge sampling,  Open  vSwitch  performs  IPFIX
                     sampling automatically on all packets that pass through a
                     bridge.  To  configure  per-bridge  sampling,  create  an
                     IPFIX  record  and point a Bridge table’s ipfix column to
                     it.  The Flow_Sample_Collector_Set table is not used  for
                     per-bridge sampling.

              ·      With  flow-based sampling, sample actions in the OpenFlow
                     flow table drive IPFIX sampling.  See ovs-ofctl(8) for  a
                     description of the sample action.

                     Flow-based sampling also requires database configuration:
                     create a IPFIX record that describes the IPFIX configura‐
                     tion  and  a Flow_Sample_Collector_Set record that points
                     to the Bridge whose flow table holds the  sample  actions
                     and  to  IPFIX  record.  The ipfix in the Bridge table is
                     not used for flow-based sampling.
