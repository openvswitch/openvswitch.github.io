ovn-sb \- OVN_Southbound database schema
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
This database holds logical and physical configuration and state for the Open Virtual Network (OVN) system to support virtual network abstraction\[char46] For an introduction to OVN, please see \fBovn\-architecture\fR(7)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The OVN Southbound database sits at the center of the OVN architecture\[char46] It is the one component that speaks both southbound directly to all the hypervisors and gateways, via \fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR, and northbound to the Cloud Management System, via \fBovn\-northd\fR:
.SS "Database Structure"
.PP
.PP
The OVN Southbound database contains classes of data with different properties, as described in the sections below\[char46]
.ST "Physical network"
.PP
.PP
Physical network tables contain information about the chassis nodes in the system\[char46] This contains all the information necessary to wire the overlay, such as IP addresses, supported tunnel types, and security keys\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The amount of physical network data is small (O(n) in the number of chassis) and it changes infrequently, so it can be replicated to every chassis\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The \fBChassis\fR and \fBEncap\fR tables are the physical network tables\[char46]
.ST "Logical Network"
.PP
.PP
Logical network tables contain the topology of logical switches and routers, ACLs, firewall rules, and everything needed to describe how packets traverse a logical network, represented as logical datapath flows (see Logical Datapath Flows, below)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Logical network data may be large (O(n) in the number of logical ports, ACL rules, etc\[char46])\[char46] Thus, to improve scaling, each chassis should receive only data related to logical networks in which that chassis participates\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The logical network data is ultimately controlled by the cloud management system (CMS) running northbound of OVN\[char46] That CMS determines the entire OVN logical configuration and therefore the logical network data at any given time is a deterministic function of the CMS\(cqs configuration, although that happens indirectly via the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database and \fBovn\-northd\fR\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Logical network data is likely to change more quickly than physical network data\[char46] This is especially true in a container environment where containers are created and destroyed (and therefore added to and deleted from logical switches) quickly\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The \fBLogical_Flow\fR, \fBMulticast_Group\fR, \fBAddress_Group\fR, \fBDHCP_Options\fR, \fBDHCPv6_Options\fR, and \fBDNS\fR tables contain logical network data\[char46]
.ST "Logical-physical bindings"
.PP
.PP
These tables link logical and physical components\[char46] They show the current placement of logical components (such as VMs and VIFs) onto chassis, and map logical entities to the values that represent them in tunnel encapsulations\[char46]
.PP
.PP
These tables change frequently, at least every time a VM powers up or down or migrates, and especially quickly in a container environment\[char46] The amount of data per VM (or VIF) is small\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Each chassis is authoritative about the VMs and VIFs that it hosts at any given time and can efficiently flood that state to a central location, so the consistency needs are minimal\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The \fBPort_Binding\fR and \fBDatapath_Binding\fR tables contain binding data\[char46]
.ST "MAC bindings"
.PP
.PP
The \fBMAC_Binding\fR table tracks the bindings from IP addresses to Ethernet addresses that are dynamically discovered using ARP (for IPv4) and neighbor discovery (for IPv6)\[char46] Usually, IP-to-MAC bindings for virtual machines are statically populated into the \fBPort_Binding\fR table, so \fBMAC_Binding\fR is primarily used to discover bindings on physical networks\[char46]
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
.PP
Some tables contain a special column named \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46] This column has the same form and purpose each place that it appears, so we describe it here to save space later\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by the software that manages the OVN Southbound database rather than by \fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR\[char46] In particular, \fBovn\-northd\fR can use key-value pairs in this column to relate entities in the southbound database to higher-level entities (such as entities in the OVN Northbound database)\[char46] Individual key-value pairs in this column may be documented in some cases to aid in understanding and troubleshooting, but the reader should not mistake such documentation as comprehensive\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should remove its own row\[char46] (This is not critical because resources hosted on the chassis are equally unreachable regardless of whether the row is present\[char46]) If a chassis shuts down permanently without removing its row, some kind of manual or automatic cleanup is eventually needed; we can devise a process for that as necessary\[char46]

In terms of performance, this actually significantly increases throughput in most common cases when running on Linux based hosts without NICs supporting encapsulation hardware offload (around 60% for bulk traffic)\[char46] The reason is that generally all NICs are capable of offloading transmitted and received TCP/UDP checksums (viewed as ordinary data packets and not as tunnels)\[char46] The benefit comes on the receive side where the validated outer checksum can be used to additionally validate an inner checksum (such as TCP), which in turn allows aggregation of packets to be more efficiently handled by the rest of the stack\[char46]
.IP
Not all devices see such a benefit\[char46] The most notable exception is hardware VTEPs\[char46] These devices are designed to not buffer entire packets in their switching engines and are therefore unable to efficiently compute or validate full packet checksums\[char46] In addition certain versions of the Linux kernel are not able to fully take advantage of encapsulation NIC offloads in the presence of checksums\[char46] (This is actually a pretty narrow corner case though - earlier versions of Linux don\(cqt support encapsulation offloads at all and later versions support both offloads and checksums well\[char46])

Each row in this table represents one logical flow\[char46] \fBovn\-northd\fR populates this table with logical flows that implement the L2 and L3 topologies specified in the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database\[char46] Each hypervisor, via \fBovn\-controller\fR, translates the logical flows into OpenFlow flows specific to its hypervisor and installs them into Open vSwitch\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Logical flows are expressed in an OVN-specific format, described here\[char46] A logical datapath flow is much like an OpenFlow flow, except that the flows are written in terms of logical ports and logical datapaths instead of physical ports and physical datapaths\[char46] Translation between logical and physical flows helps to ensure isolation between logical datapaths\[char46] (The logical flow abstraction also allows the OVN centralized components to do less work, since they do not have to separately compute and push out physical flows to each chassis\[char46])
.PP
.PP
The default action when no flow matches is to drop packets\[char46]
.PP
\fBArchitectural Logical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR
.PP
.PP
This following description focuses on the life cycle of a packet through a logical datapath, ignoring physical details of the implementation\[char46] Please refer to \fBArchitectural Physical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR in \fBovn\-architecture\fR(7) for the physical information\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The description here is written as if OVN itself executes these steps, but in fact OVN (that is, \fBovn\-controller\fR) programs Open vSwitch, via OpenFlow and OVSDB, to execute them on its behalf\[char46]
.PP
.PP
At a high level, OVN passes each packet through the logical datapath\(cqs logical ingress pipeline, which may output the packet to one or more logical port or logical multicast groups\[char46] For each such logical output port, OVN passes the packet through the datapath\(cqs logical egress pipeline, which may either drop the packet or deliver it to the destination\[char46] Between the two pipelines, outputs to logical multicast groups are expanded into logical ports, so that the egress pipeline only processes a single logical output port at a time\[char46] Between the two pipelines is also where, when necessary, OVN encapsulates a packet in a tunnel (or tunnels) to transmit to remote hypervisors\[char46]
.PP
.PP
In more detail, to start, OVN searches the \fBLogical_Flow\fR table for a row with correct \fBlogical_datapath\fR, a \fBpipeline\fR of \fBingress\fR, a \fBtable_id\fR of 0, and a \fBmatch\fR that is true for the packet\[char46] If none is found, OVN drops the packet\[char46] If OVN finds more than one, it chooses the match with the highest \fBpriority\fR\[char46] Then OVN executes each of the actions specified in the row\(cqs \fBactions\fR column, in the order specified\[char46] Some actions, such as those to modify packet headers, require no further details\[char46] The \fBnext\fR and \fBoutput\fR actions are special\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The \fBnext\fR action causes the above process to be repeated recursively, except that OVN searches for \fBtable_id\fR of 1 instead of 0\[char46] Similarly, any \fBnext\fR action in a row found in that table would cause a further search for a \fBtable_id\fR of 2, and so on\[char46] When recursive processing completes, flow control returns to the action following \fBnext\fR\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The \fBoutput\fR action also introduces recursion\[char46] Its effect depends on the current value of the \fBoutport\fR field\[char46] Suppose \fBoutport\fR designates a logical port\[char46] First, OVN compares \fBinport\fR to \fBoutport\fR; if they are equal, it treats the \fBoutput\fR as a no-op by default\[char46] In the common case, where they are different, the packet enters the egress pipeline\[char46] This transition to the egress pipeline discards register data, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBreg0\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] \fBreg9\fR and connection tracking state, to achieve uniform behavior regardless of whether the egress pipeline is on a different hypervisor (because registers aren\(cqt preserve across tunnel encapsulation)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
To execute the egress pipeline, OVN again searches the \fBLogical_Flow\fR table for a row with correct \fBlogical_datapath\fR, a \fBtable_id\fR of 0, a \fBmatch\fR that is true for the packet, but now looking for a \fBpipeline\fR of \fBegress\fR\[char46] If no matching row is found, the output becomes a no-op\[char46] Otherwise, OVN executes the actions for the matching flow (which is chosen from multiple, if necessary, as already described)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
In the \fBegress\fR pipeline, the \fBnext\fR action acts as already described, except that it, of course, searches for \fBegress\fR flows\[char46] The \fBoutput\fR action, however, now directly outputs the packet to the output port (which is now fixed, because \fBoutport\fR is read-only within the egress pipeline)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The description earlier assumed that \fBoutport\fR referred to a logical port\[char46] If it instead designates a logical multicast group, then the description above still applies, with the addition of fan-out from the logical multicast group to each logical port in the group\[char46] For each member of the group, OVN executes the logical pipeline as described, with the logical output port replaced by the group member\[char46]

.RE
.IP
\fBLevel of Measurement\fR\[char46] See http://en\[char46]wikipedia\[char46]org/wiki/Level_of_measurement for the statistical concept on which this classification is based\[char46] There are three levels:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fIOrdinal\fR\[char46] In statistics, ordinal values can be ordered on a scale\[char46] OVN considers a field (or subfield) to be ordinal if its bits can be examined individually\[char46] This is true for the OpenFlow fields that OpenFlow or Open vSwitch makes ``maskable\[char46]\(cq\(cq

Any use of a ordinal field may specify a single bit or a range of bits, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]tci[13\[char46]\[char46]15]\fR refers to the PCP field within the VLAN TCI, and \fBeth\[char46]dst[40]\fR refers to the multicast bit in the Ethernet destination address\[char46]
.IP
OVN supports all the usual arithmetic relations (\fB==\fR, \fB!=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR, \fB>\fR, and \fB>=\fR) on ordinal fields and their subfields, because OVN can implement these in OpenFlow and Open vSwitch as collections of bitwise tests\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fINominal\fR\[char46] In statistics, nominal values cannot be usefully compared except for equality\[char46] This is true of OpenFlow port numbers, Ethernet types, and IP protocols are examples: all of these are just identifiers assigned arbitrarily with no deeper meaning\[char46] In OpenFlow and Open vSwitch, bits in these fields generally aren\(cqt individually addressable\[char46]
.IP
OVN only supports arithmetic tests for equality on nominal fields, because OpenFlow and Open vSwitch provide no way for a flow to efficiently implement other comparisons on them\[char46] (A test for inequality can be sort of built out of two flows with different priorities, but OVN matching expressions always generate flows with a single priority\[char46])
.IP
String fields are always nominal\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fIBoolean\fR\[char46] A nominal field that has only two values, 0 and 1, is somewhat exceptional, since it is easy to support both equality and inequality tests on such a field: either one can be implemented as a test for 0 or 1\[char46]

.IP "\fBactions\fR: string"
Logical datapath actions, to be executed when the logical flow represented by this row is the highest-priority match\[char46]
.IP
Actions share lexical syntax with the \fBmatch\fR column\[char46] An empty set of actions (or one that contains just white space or comments), or a set of actions that consists of just \fBdrop;\fR, causes the matched packets to be dropped\[char46] Otherwise, the column should contain a sequence of actions, each terminated by a semicolon\[char46]
.IP
The following actions are defined:
.RS
.TP
\fBoutput;\fR
In the ingress pipeline, this action executes the \fBegress\fR pipeline as a subroutine\[char46] If \fBoutport\fR names a logical port, the egress pipeline executes once; if it is a multicast group, the egress pipeline runs once for each logical port in the group\[char46]
.IP
In the egress pipeline, this action performs the actual output to the \fBoutport\fR logical port\[char46] (In the egress pipeline, \fBoutport\fR never names a multicast group\[char46])
.IP
By default, output to the input port is implicitly dropped, that is, \fBoutput\fR becomes a no-op if \fBoutport\fR == \fBinport\fR\[char46] Occasionally it may be useful to override this behavior, e\[char46]g\[char46] to send an ARP reply to an ARP request; to do so, use \fBflags\[char46]loopback = 1\fR to allow the packet to \(dqhair-pin\(dq back to the input port\[char46]
.TP
\fBnext;\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBnext(\fItable\fB);\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBnext(pipeline=\fIpipeline\fB, table=\fItable\fB);\fR
Executes the given logical datapath \fItable\fR in \fIpipeline\fR as a subroutine\[char46] The default \fItable\fR is just after the current one\[char46] If \fIpipeline\fR is specified, it may be \fBingress\fR or \fBegress\fR; the default \fIpipeline\fR is the one currently executing\[char46] Actions in the ingress pipeline may not use \fBnext\fR to jump into the egress pipeline (use the \fBoutput\fR instead), but transitions in the opposite direction are allowed\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield\fB = \fIconstant\fB;\fR
Sets data or metadata field \fIfield\fR to constant value \fIconstant\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBoutport = \(dqvif0\(dq;\fR to set the logical output port\[char46] To set only a subset of bits in a field, specify a subfield for \fIfield\fR or a masked \fIconstant\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] one may use \fBvlan\[char46]pcp[2] = 1;\fR or \fBvlan\[char46]pcp = 4/4;\fR to set the most sigificant bit of the VLAN PCP\[char46]
.IP
Assigning to a field with prerequisites implicitly adds those prerequisites to \fBmatch\fR; thus, for example, a flow that sets \fBtcp\[char46]dst\fR applies only to TCP flows, regardless of whether its \fBmatch\fR mentions any TCP field\[char46]
.IP
Not all fields are modifiable (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBeth\[char46]type\fR and \fBip\[char46]proto\fR are read-only), and not all modifiable fields may be partially modified (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBip\[char46]ttl\fR must assigned as a whole)\[char46] The \fBoutport\fR field is modifiable in the \fBingress\fR pipeline but not in the \fBegress\fR pipeline\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield1\fB = \fIfield2\fB;\fR
Sets data or metadata field \fIfield1\fR to the value of data or metadata field \fIfield2\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBreg0 =
ip4\[char46]src;\fR copies \fBip4\[char46]src\fR into \fBreg0\fR\[char46] To modify only a subset of a field\(cqs bits, specify a subfield for \fIfield1\fR or \fIfield2\fR or both, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]pcp
= reg0[0\[char46]\[char46]2];\fR copies the least-significant bits of \fBreg0\fR into the VLAN PCP\[char46]
.IP
\fIfield1\fR and \fIfield2\fR must be the same type, either both string or both integer fields\[char46] If they are both integer fields, they must have the same width\[char46]
.IP
If \fIfield1\fR or \fIfield2\fR has prerequisites, they are added implicitly to \fBmatch\fR\[char46] It is possible to write an assignment with contradictory prerequisites, such as \fBip4\[char46]src = ip6\[char46]src[0\[char46]\[char46]31];\fR, but the contradiction means that a logical flow with such an assignment will never be matched\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield1\fB <\-> \fIfield2\fB;\fR
Similar to \fB\fIfield1\fB = \fIfield2\fB;\fR except that the two values are exchanged instead of copied\[char46] Both \fIfield1\fR and \fIfield2\fR must modifiable\[char46]
.TP
\fBip\[char46]ttl\-\-;\fR
Decrements the IPv4 or IPv6 TTL\[char46] If this would make the TTL zero or negative, then processing of the packet halts; no further actions are processed\[char46] (To properly handle such cases, a higher-priority flow should match on \fBip\[char46]ttl == {0, 1};\fR\[char46])
.IP
\fBPrerequisite:\fR \fBip\fR
.TP
\fBct_next;\fR
Apply connection tracking to the flow, initializing \fBct_state\fR for matching in later tables\[char46] Automatically moves on to the next table, as if followed by \fBnext\fR\[char46]
.IP
As a side effect, IP fragments will be reassembled for matching\[char46] If a fragmented packet is output, then it will be sent with any overlapping fragments squashed\[char46] The connection tracking state is scoped by the logical port when the action is used in a flow for a logical switch, so overlapping addresses may be used\[char46] To allow traffic related to the matched flow, execute \fBct_commit
\fR\[char46] Connection tracking state is scoped by the logical topology when the action is used in a flow for a router\[char46]
.IP
It is possible to have actions follow \fBct_next\fR, but they will not have access to any of its side-effects and is not generally useful\[char46]
.TP
\fBct_commit;\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBct_commit(ct_mark=\fIvalue[/mask]\fB);\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBct_commit(ct_label=\fIvalue[/mask]\fB);\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBct_commit(ct_mark=\fIvalue[/mask]\fB, ct_label=\fIvalue[/mask]\fB);\fR
Commit the flow to the connection tracking entry associated with it by a previous call to \fBct_next\fR\[char46] When \fBct_mark=\fIvalue[/mask]\fB\fR and/or \fBct_label=\fIvalue[/mask]\fB\fR are supplied, \fBct_mark\fR and/or \fBct_label\fR will be set to the values indicated by \fIvalue[/mask]\fR on the connection tracking entry\[char46] \fBct_mark\fR is a 32-bit field\[char46] \fBct_label\fR is a 128-bit field\[char46] The \fIvalue[/mask]\fR should be specified in hex string if more than 64bits are to be used\[char46]
.IP
Note that if you want processing to continue in the next table, you must execute the \fBnext\fR action after \fBct_commit\fR\[char46] You may also leave out \fBnext\fR which will commit connection tracking state, and then drop the packet\[char46] This could be useful for setting \fBct_mark\fR on a connection tracking entry before dropping a packet, for example\[char46]
.TP
\fBct_dnat;\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBct_dnat(\fIIP\fB);\fR
\fBct_dnat\fR sends the packet through the DNAT zone in connection tracking table to unDNAT any packet that was DNATed in the opposite direction\[char46] The packet is then automatically sent to to the next tables as if followed by \fBnext;\fR action\[char46] The next tables will see the changes in the packet caused by the connection tracker\[char46]
.IP
\fBct_dnat(\fIIP\fB)\fR sends the packet through the DNAT zone to change the destination IP address of the packet to the one provided inside the parentheses and commits the connection\[char46] The packet is then automatically sent to the next tables as if followed by \fBnext;\fR action\[char46] The next tables will see the changes in the packet caused by the connection tracker\[char46]

Each row in this table specifies a binding from an IP address to an Ethernet address that has been discovered through ARP (for IPv4) or neighbor discovery (for IPv6)\[char46] This table is primarily used to discover bindings on physical networks, because IP-to-MAC bindings for virtual machines are usually populated statically into the \fBPort_Binding\fR table\[char46]

.PP

In outline, the lifetime of a logical router\(cqs MAC binding looks like this:
.RS
.IP 1. .4in
On hypervisor 1, a logical router determines that a packet should be forwarded to IP address \fIA\fR on one of its router ports\[char46] It uses its logical flow table to determine that \fIA\fR lacks a static IP-to-MAC binding and the \fBget_arp\fR action to determine that it lacks a dynamic IP-to-MAC binding\[char46]
.IP 2. .4in
Using an OVN logical \fBarp\fR action, the logical router generates and sends a broadcast ARP request to the router port\[char46] It drops the IP packet\[char46]
.IP 3. .4in
The logical switch attached to the router port delivers the ARP request to all of its ports\[char46] (It might make sense to deliver it only to ports that have no static IP-to-MAC bindings, but this could also be surprising behavior\[char46])
.IP 4. .4in
A host or VM on hypervisor 2 (which might be the same as hypervisor 1) attached to the logical switch owns the IP address in question\[char46] It composes an ARP reply and unicasts it to the logical router port\(cqs Ethernet address\[char46]
.IP 5. .4in
The logical switch delivers the ARP reply to the logical router port\[char46]
.IP 6. .4in
The logical router flow table executes a \fBput_arp\fR action\[char46] To record the IP-to-MAC binding, \fBovn\-controller\fR adds a row to the \fBMAC_Binding\fR table\[char46]
.IP 7. .4in
On hypervisor 1, \fBovn\-controller\fR receives the updated \fBMAC_Binding\fR table from the OVN southbound database\[char46] The next packet destined to \fIA\fR through the logical router is sent directly to the bound Ethernet address\[char46]
