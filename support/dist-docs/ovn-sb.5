ovn-sb \- OVN_Southbound database schema
.PP
This database holds logical and physical configuration and state for the
Open Virtual Network (OVN) system to support virtual network abstraction\[char46]
For an introduction to OVN, please see \fBovn\-architecture\fR(7)\[char46]
.PP
The OVN Southbound database sits at the center of the OVN
architecture\[char46]  It is the one component that speaks both southbound
directly to all the hypervisors and gateways, via
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR, and
northbound to the Cloud Management System, via \fBovn\-northd\fR:
.SS "Database Structure"
.PP
The OVN Southbound database contains classes of data with
different properties, as described in the sections below\[char46]
.ST "Physical Network (PN) data"
.PP
PN tables contain information about the chassis nodes in the system\[char46]  This
contains all the information necessary to wire the overlay, such as IP
addresses, supported tunnel types, and security keys\[char46]
.PP
The amount of PN data is small (O(n) in the number of chassis) and it
changes infrequently, so it can be replicated to every chassis\[char46]
.PP
The \fBChassis\fR table comprises the PN tables\[char46]
.ST "Logical Network (LN) data"
.PP
LN tables contain the topology of logical switches and routers, ACLs,
firewall rules, and everything needed to describe how packets traverse a
logical network, represented as logical datapath flows (see Logical
Datapath Flows, below)\[char46]
.PP
LN data may be large (O(n) in the number of logical ports, ACL rules,
etc\[char46])\[char46]  Thus, to improve scaling, each chassis should receive only data
related to logical networks in which that chassis participates\[char46]  Past
experience shows that in the presence of large logical networks, even
finer-grained partitioning of data, e\[char46]g\[char46] designing logical flows so that
only the chassis hosting a logical port needs related flows, pays off
scale-wise\[char46]  (This is not necessary initially but it is worth bearing in
mind in the design\[char46])
.PP
The LN is a slave of the cloud management system running northbound of OVN\[char46]
That CMS determines the entire OVN logical configuration and therefore the
LN\(cqs content at any given time is a deterministic function of the CMS\(cqs
configuration, although that happens indirectly via the
\fBOVN_Northbound\fR database and \fBovn\-northd\fR\[char46]
.PP
LN data is likely to change more quickly than PN data\[char46]  This is especially
true in a container environment where VMs are created and destroyed (and
therefore added to and deleted from logical switches) quickly\[char46]
.PP
\fBLogical_Flow\fR and \fBMulticast_Group\fR contain LN
data\[char46]
.ST "Logical-physical bindings"
.PP
These tables link logical and physical components\[char46]  They show the current
placement of logical components (such as VMs and VIFs) onto chassis, and
map logical entities to the values that represent them in tunnel
encapsulations\[char46]
.PP
These tables change frequently, at least every time a VM powers up or down
or migrates, and especially quickly in a container environment\[char46]  The
amount of data per VM (or VIF) is small\[char46]
.PP
Each chassis is authoritative about the VMs and VIFs that it hosts at any
given time and can efficiently flood that state to a central location, so
the consistency needs are minimal\[char46]
.PP
The \fBPort_Binding\fR and \fBDatapath_Binding\fR tables
contain binding data\[char46]
.ST "MAC bindings"
.PP
The \fBMAC_Binding\fR table tracks the bindings from IP addresses
to Ethernet addresses that are dynamically discovered using ARP (for IPv4)
and neighbor discovery (for IPv6)\[char46]  Usually, IP-to-MAC bindings for virtual
machines are statically populated into the \fBPort_Binding\fR
table, so \fBMAC_Binding\fR is primarily used to discover bindings
on physical networks\[char46]
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
Some tables contain a special column named \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46]  This
column has the same form and purpose each place that it appears, so we
describe it here to save space later\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by the software that manages the OVN Southbound
database rather than by
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR\[char46]  In
particular, \fBovn\-northd\fR can use key-value pairs in this
column to relate entities in the southbound database to higher-level
entities (such as entities in the OVN Northbound database)\[char46]  Individual
key-value pairs in this column may be documented in some cases to aid
in understanding and troubleshooting, but the reader should not mistake
such documentation as comprehensive\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

\fBovn\-controller\fR, translates the logical flows into
OpenFlow flows specific to its hypervisor and installs them into
Open vSwitch\[char46]
.PP
Logical flows are expressed in an OVN-specific format, described here\[char46]  A
logical datapath flow is much like an OpenFlow flow, except that the
flows are written in terms of logical ports and logical datapaths instead
of physical ports and physical datapaths\[char46]  Translation between logical
and physical flows helps to ensure isolation between logical datapaths\[char46]
(The logical flow abstraction also allows the OVN centralized
components to do less work, since they do not have to separately
compute and push out physical flows to each chassis\[char46])
.PP
The default action when no flow matches is to drop packets\[char46]
.PP
\fBArchitectural Logical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR
.PP
This following description focuses on the life cycle of a packet through
a logical datapath, ignoring physical details of the implementation\[char46]
Please refer to \fBArchitectural Physical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR in
\fBovn\-architecture\fR(7) for the physical information\[char46]
.PP
The description here is written as if OVN itself executes these steps,
but in fact OVN (that is, \fBovn\-controller\fR) programs Open
vSwitch, via OpenFlow and OVSDB, to execute them on its behalf\[char46]
.PP
At a high level, OVN passes each packet through the logical datapath\(cqs
logical ingress pipeline, which may output the packet to one or more
logical port or logical multicast groups\[char46]  For each such logical output
port, OVN passes the packet through the datapath\(cqs logical egress
pipeline, which may either drop the packet or deliver it to the
destination\[char46]  Between the two pipelines, outputs to logical multicast
groups are expanded into logical ports, so that the egress pipeline only
processes a single logical output port at a time\[char46]  Between the two
pipelines is also where, when necessary, OVN encapsulates a packet in a
tunnel (or tunnels) to transmit to remote hypervisors\[char46]
.PP
In more detail, to start, OVN searches the \fBLogical_Flow\fR
table for a row with correct \fBlogical_datapath\fR, a \fBpipeline\fR of \fBingress\fR, a \fBtable_id\fR
of 0, and a \fBmatch\fR that is true for the packet\[char46]  If none
is found, OVN drops the packet\[char46]  If OVN finds more than one, it chooses
the match with the highest \fBpriority\fR\[char46]  Then OVN executes
each of the actions specified in the row\(cqs \fBactions\fR column,
in the order specified\[char46]  Some actions, such as those to modify packet
headers, require no further details\[char46]  The \fBnext\fR and
\fBoutput\fR actions are special\[char46]
.PP
The \fBnext\fR action causes the above process to be repeated
recursively, except that OVN searches for \fBtable_id\fR of 1
instead of 0\[char46]  Similarly, any \fBnext\fR action in a row found in
that table would cause a further search for a \fBtable_id\fR of
2, and so on\[char46]  When recursive processing completes, flow control returns
to the action following \fBnext\fR\[char46]
.PP
The \fBoutput\fR action also introduces recursion\[char46]  Its effect
depends on the current value of the \fBoutport\fR field\[char46]  Suppose
\fBoutport\fR designates a logical port\[char46]  First, OVN compares
\fBinport\fR to \fBoutport\fR; if they are equal, it treats
the \fBoutput\fR as a no-op\[char46]  In the common case, where they are
different, the packet enters the egress pipeline\[char46]  This transition to the
egress pipeline discards register data, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBreg0\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
\fBreg4\fR and connection tracking state, to achieve
uniform behavior regardless of whether the egress pipeline is on a
different hypervisor (because registers aren\(cqt preserve across
tunnel encapsulation)\[char46]
.PP
To execute the egress pipeline, OVN again searches the \fBLogical_Flow\fR table for a row with correct \fBlogical_datapath\fR, a \fBtable_id\fR of 0, a \fBmatch\fR that is true for the packet, but now looking for a \fBpipeline\fR of \fBegress\fR\[char46]  If no matching row is found,
the output becomes a no-op\[char46]  Otherwise, OVN executes the actions for the
matching flow (which is chosen from multiple, if necessary, as already
described)\[char46]
.PP
In the \fBegress\fR pipeline, the \fBnext\fR action acts as
already described, except that it, of course, searches for
\fBegress\fR flows\[char46]  The \fBoutput\fR action, however, now
directly outputs the packet to the output port (which is now fixed,
because \fBoutport\fR is read-only within the egress pipeline)\[char46]
.PP
The description earlier assumed that \fBoutport\fR referred to a
logical port\[char46]  If it instead designates a logical multicast group, then
the description above still applies, with the addition of fan-out from
the logical multicast group to each logical port in the group\[char46]  For each
member of the group, OVN executes the logical pipeline as described, with
the logical output port replaced by the group member\[char46]
.PP
\fBPipeline Stages\fR
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR is responsible for populating the
\fBLogical_Flow\fR table, so the stages are an
implementation detail and subject to change\[char46]  This section
describes the current logical flow table\[char46]
.PP
The ingress pipeline consists of the following stages:
.RS

packets with a VLAN tag, and, if configured, verifies that the

.IP "\fBlogical_datapath\fR: \fBDatapath_Binding\fR"
The logical datapath to which the logical flow belongs\[char46]
.IP "\fBpipeline\fR: string, either \fBingress\fR or \fBegress\fR"
The primary flows used for deciding on a packet\(cqs destination are the
\fBingress\fR flows\[char46]  The \fBegress\fR flows implement
ACLs\[char46]  See \fBLogical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR, above, for details\[char46]
.IP "\fBtable_id\fR: integer, in range 0 to 15"
The stage in the logical pipeline, analogous to an OpenFlow table number\[char46]
.IP "\fBpriority\fR: integer, in range 0 to 65,535"
The flow\(cqs priority\[char46]  Flows with numerically higher priority take
precedence over those with lower\[char46]  If two logical datapath flows with the
same priority both match, then the one actually applied to the packet is
undefined\[char46]
.IP "\fBmatch\fR: string"
A matching expression\[char46]  OVN provides a superset of OpenFlow matching
capabilities, using a syntax similar to Boolean expressions in a
programming language\[char46]
.IP
The most important components of match expression are
\fIcomparisons\fR between \fIsymbols\fR and
\fIconstants\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBip4\[char46]dst == 192\[char46]168\[char46]0\[char46]1\fR,
\fBip\[char46]proto == 6\fR, \fBarp\[char46]op == 1\fR, \fBeth\[char46]type ==
0x800\fR\[char46]  The logical AND operator \fB&&\fR and
logical OR operator \fB||\fR can combine comparisons into a
larger expression\[char46]
.IP
Matching expressions also support parentheses for grouping, the logical
NOT prefix operator \fB!\fR, and literals \fB0\fR and
\fB1\fR to express ``false\(cq\(cq or ``true,\(cq\(cq respectively\[char46]  The
latter is useful by itself as a catch-all expression that matches every
packet\[char46]
.IP
\fBSymbols\fR
.IP
\fBType\fR\[char46]  Symbols have \fIinteger\fR or \fIstring\fR
type\[char46]  Integer symbols have a \fIwidth\fR in bits\[char46]
.IP
\fBKinds\fR\[char46]  There are three kinds of symbols:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fIFields\fR\[char46]  A field symbol represents a packet header or
metadata field\[char46]  For example, a field
named \fBvlan\[char46]tci\fR might represent the VLAN TCI field in a
packet\[char46]
.IP
A field symbol can have integer or string type\[char46]  Integer fields can
be nominal or ordinal (see \fBLevel of Measurement\fR,
below)\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fISubfields\fR\[char46]  A subfield represents a subset of bits from
a larger field\[char46]  For example, a field \fBvlan\[char46]vid\fR might
be defined as an alias for \fBvlan\[char46]tci[0\[char46]\[char46]11]\fR\[char46]  Subfields
are provided for syntactic convenience, because it is always
possible to instead refer to a subset of bits from a field
directly\[char46]
.IP
Only ordinal fields (see \fBLevel of Measurement\fR,
below) may have subfields\[char46]  Subfields are always ordinal\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fIPredicates\fR\[char46]  A predicate is shorthand for a Boolean
expression\[char46]  Predicates may be used much like 1-bit fields\[char46]  For
example, \fBip4\fR might expand to \fBeth\[char46]type ==
0x800\fR\[char46]  Predicates are provided for syntactic convenience,
because it is always possible to instead specify the underlying
expression directly\[char46]
.IP
A predicate whose expansion refers to any nominal field or
predicate (see \fBLevel of Measurement\fR, below) is nominal;
other predicates have Boolean level of measurement\[char46]
.RE
.IP
\fBLevel of Measurement\fR\[char46]  See
http://en\[char46]wikipedia\[char46]org/wiki/Level_of_measurement for the statistical
concept on which this classification is based\[char46]  There are three
levels:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fIOrdinal\fR\[char46]  In statistics, ordinal values can be ordered
on a scale\[char46]  OVN considers a field (or subfield) to be ordinal if
its bits can be examined individually\[char46]  This is true for the
OpenFlow fields that OpenFlow or Open vSwitch makes ``maskable\[char46]\(cq\(cq
.IP
Any use of a nominal field may specify a single bit or a range of
bits, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]tci[13\[char46]\[char46]15]\fR refers to the PCP field
within the VLAN TCI, and \fBeth\[char46]dst[40]\fR refers to the
multicast bit in the Ethernet destination address\[char46]
.IP
OVN supports all the usual arithmetic relations (\fB==\fR,
\fB!=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR,
\fB>\fR, and \fB>=\fR) on ordinal fields and
their subfields, because OVN can implement these in OpenFlow and
Open vSwitch as collections of bitwise tests\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fINominal\fR\[char46]  In statistics, nominal values cannot be
usefully compared except for equality\[char46]  This is true of OpenFlow
port numbers, Ethernet types, and IP protocols are examples: all of
these are just identifiers assigned arbitrarily with no deeper
meaning\[char46]  In OpenFlow and Open vSwitch, bits in these fields
generally aren\(cqt individually addressable\[char46]
.IP
OVN only supports arithmetic tests for equality on nominal fields,
because OpenFlow and Open vSwitch provide no way for a flow to
efficiently implement other comparisons on them\[char46]  (A test for
inequality can be sort of built out of two flows with different
priorities, but OVN matching expressions always generate flows with
a single priority\[char46])
.IP
String fields are always nominal\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fIBoolean\fR\[char46]  A nominal field that has only two values, 0
and 1, is somewhat exceptional, since it is easy to support both
equality and inequality tests on such a field: either one can be
implemented as a test for 0 or 1\[char46]
.IP
Only predicates (see above) have a Boolean level of measurement\[char46]
.IP
This isn\(cqt a standard level of measurement\[char46]
.RE
.IP
\fBPrerequisites\fR\[char46]  Any symbol can have prerequisites, which are
additional condition implied by the use of the symbol\[char46]  For example,
For example, \fBicmp4\[char46]type\fR symbol might have prerequisite
\fBicmp4\fR, which would cause an expression \fBicmp4\[char46]type ==
0\fR to be interpreted as \fBicmp4\[char46]type == 0 &&
icmp4\fR, which would in turn expand to \fBicmp4\[char46]type == 0
&& eth\[char46]type == 0x800 && ip4\[char46]proto == 1\fR (assuming
\fBicmp4\fR is a predicate defined as suggested under
\fBTypes\fR above)\[char46]
.IP
\fBRelational operators\fR
.IP
All of the standard relational operators \fB==\fR,
\fB!=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR,
\fB>\fR, and \fB>=\fR are supported\[char46]  Nominal
fields support only \fB==\fR and \fB!=\fR, and only in a
positive sense when outer \fB!\fR are taken into account,
e\[char46]g\[char46] given string field \fBinport\fR, \fBinport ==
\(dqeth0\(dq\fR and \fB!(inport != \(dqeth0\(dq)\fR are acceptable, but
not \fBinport != \(dqeth0\(dq\fR\[char46]
.IP
The implementation of \fB==\fR (or \fB!=\fR when it is
negated), is more efficient than that of the other relational
operators\[char46]
.IP
\fBConstants\fR
.IP
Integer constants may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal prefixed by
\fB0x\fR, or as dotted-quad IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses in
their standard forms, or Ethernet addresses as colon-separated hex
digits\[char46]  A constant in any of these forms may be followed by a slash
and a second constant (the mask) in the same form, to form a masked
constant\[char46]  IPv4 and IPv6 masks may be given as integers, to express
CIDR prefixes\[char46]
.IP
String constants have the same syntax as quoted strings in JSON (thus,
they are Unicode strings)\[char46]
.IP
Some operators support sets of constants written inside curly braces
\fB{\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] \fB}\fR\[char46]  Commas between elements of a set,
and after the last elements, are optional\[char46]  With \fB==\fR,
``\fB\fIfield\fB == { \fIconstant1\fB,
\fIconstant2\fB,\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] \fB}\fR\(cq\(cq is syntactic sugar
for ``\fB\fIfield\fB == \fIconstant1\fB ||
\fIfield\fB == \fIconstant2\fB || \fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]\fB\fR\[char46]
Similarly, ``\fB\fIfield\fB != { \fIconstant1\fB,
\fIconstant2\fB, \fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]\fB }\fR\(cq\(cq is equivalent to
``\fB\fIfield\fB != \fIconstant1\fB &&
\fIfield\fB != \fIconstant2\fB &&
\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]\fB\fR\(cq\(cq\[char46]
.IP
You may refer to a set of IPv4, IPv6, or MAC addresses stored in the
\fBAddress_Set\fR table by its \fBname\fR\[char46]  An \fBAddress_Set\fR with a name
of \fBset1\fR can be referred to as
\fB$set1\fR\[char46]
.IP
\fBMiscellaneous\fR
.IP
Comparisons may name the symbol or the constant first,
e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBtcp\[char46]src == 80\fR and \fB80 == tcp\[char46]src\fR are both
acceptable\[char46]
.IP
Tests for a range may be expressed using a syntax like \fB1024 <=
tcp\[char46]src <= 49151\fR, which is equivalent to \fB1024 <=
tcp\[char46]src && tcp\[char46]src <= 49151\fR\[char46]
.IP
For a one-bit field or predicate, a mention of its name is equivalent
to \fB\fIsymobl\fB == 1\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]present\fR
is equivalent to \fBvlan\[char46]present == 1\fR\[char46]  The same is true for
one-bit subfields, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]tci[12]\fR\[char46]  There is no
technical limitation to implementing the same for ordinal fields of all
widths, but the implementation is expensive enough that the syntax
parser requires writing an explicit comparison against zero to make
mistakes less likely, e\[char46]g\[char46] in \fBtcp\[char46]src != 0\fR the comparison
against 0 is required\[char46]
.IP
\fBOperator precedence\fR is as shown below, from highest to lowest\[char46]
There are two exceptions where parentheses are required even though the
table would suggest that they are not: \fB&&\fR and
\fB||\fR require parentheses when used together, and
\fB!\fR requires parentheses when applied to a relational
expression\[char46]  Thus, in \fB(eth\[char46]type == 0x800 || eth\[char46]type == 0x86dd)
&& ip\[char46]proto == 6\fR or \fB!(arp\[char46]op == 1)\fR, the
parentheses are mandatory\[char46]

Logical datapath actions, to be executed when the logical flow
represented by this row is the highest-priority match\[char46]
.IP
Actions share lexical syntax with the \fBmatch\fR column\[char46]  An
empty set of actions (or one that contains just white space or
comments), or a set of actions that consists of just
\fBdrop;\fR, causes the matched packets to be dropped\[char46]
Otherwise, the column should contain a sequence of actions, each
terminated by a semicolon\[char46]
.IP
The following actions are defined:
.RS
.TP
\fBoutput;\fR
In the ingress pipeline, this action executes the
\fBegress\fR pipeline as a subroutine\[char46]  If
\fBoutport\fR names a logical port, the egress pipeline
executes once; if it is a multicast group, the egress pipeline runs
once for each logical port in the group\[char46]
.IP
In the egress pipeline, this action performs the actual
output to the \fBoutport\fR logical port\[char46]  (In the egress
pipeline, \fBoutport\fR never names a multicast group\[char46])
.IP
Output to the input port is implicitly dropped, that is,
\fBoutput\fR becomes a no-op if \fBoutport\fR ==
\fBinport\fR\[char46]  Occasionally it may be useful to override
this behavior, e\[char46]g\[char46] to send an ARP reply to an ARP request; to do
so, use \fBinport = \(dq\(dq;\fR to set the logical input port to
an empty string (which should not be used as the name of any

\fBnext(\fItable\fB);\fR
Executes another logical datapath table as a subroutine\[char46]  By default,
the table after the current one is executed\[char46]  Specify
\fItable\fR to jump to a specific table in the same pipeline\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield\fB = \fIconstant\fB;\fR
Sets data or metadata field \fIfield\fR to constant value
\fIconstant\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBoutport = \(dqvif0\(dq;\fR to set the
logical output port\[char46]  To set only a subset of bits in a field,

\fIconstant\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] one may use \fBvlan\[char46]pcp[2] = 1;\fR
or \fBvlan\[char46]pcp = 4/4;\fR to set the most sigificant bit of
the VLAN PCP\[char46]
.IP
Assigning to a field with prerequisites implicitly adds those
prerequisites to \fBmatch\fR; thus, for example, a flow

regardless of whether its \fBmatch\fR mentions any TCP
field\[char46]

Not all fields are modifiable (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBeth\[char46]type\fR and

\fIfield1\fR and \fIfield2\fR must be the same type,
either both string or both integer fields\[char46]  If they are both
integer fields, they must have the same width\[char46]

If \fIfield1\fR or \fIfield2\fR has prerequisites, they

write an assignment with contradictory prerequisites, such as
\fBip4\[char46]src = ip6\[char46]src[0\[char46]\[char46]31];\fR, but the contradiction means
that a logical flow with such an assignment will never be matched\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield1\fB <\-> \fIfield2\fB;\fR
Similar to \fB\fIfield1\fB = \fIfield2\fB;\fR

\fBip\[char46]ttl\-\-;\fR
Decrements the IPv4 or IPv6 TTL\[char46]  If this would make the TTL zero

inside a VM\[char46]  They are empty for containers or VMs that run directly on
a hypervisor\[char46]

.SH "MAC_Binding TABLE"
Each row in this table specifies a binding from an IP address to an
Ethernet address that has been discovered through ARP (for IPv4) or
neighbor discovery (for IPv6)\[char46]  This table is primarily used to discover
bindings on physical networks, because IP-to-MAC bindings for virtual
machines are usually populated statically into the \fBPort_Binding\fR table\[char46]
.PP
This table expresses a functional relationship: \fBMAC_Binding\fR(\fBlogical_port\fR, \fBip\fR) =
\fBmac\fR\[char46]
.PP
In outline, the lifetime of a logical router\(cqs MAC binding looks like
this:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
On hypervisor 1, a logical router determines that a packet should be
forwarded to IP address \fIA\fR on one of its router ports\[char46]  It
uses its logical flow table to determine that \fIA\fR lacks a
static IP-to-MAC binding and the \fBget_arp\fR action to
determine that it lacks a dynamic IP-to-MAC binding\[char46]
.IP 2. .25in
Using an OVN logical \fBarp\fR action, the logical router
generates and sends a broadcast ARP request to the router port\[char46]  It
drops the IP packet\[char46]
.IP 3. .25in
The logical switch attached to the router port delivers the ARP request
to all of its ports\[char46]  (It might make sense to deliver it only to ports
that have no static IP-to-MAC bindings, but this could also be
surprising behavior\[char46])
.IP 4. .25in
A host or VM on hypervisor 2 (which might be the same as hypervisor 1)
attached to the logical switch owns the IP address in question\[char46]  It
composes an ARP reply and unicasts it to the logical router port\(cqs
Ethernet address\[char46]
.IP 5. .25in
The logical switch delivers the ARP reply to the logical router port\[char46]
.IP 6. .25in
The logical router flow table executes a \fBput_arp\fR action\[char46]
To record the IP-to-MAC binding, \fBovn\-controller\fR adds a row
to the \fBMAC_Binding\fR table\[char46]
.IP 7. .25in
On hypervisor 1, \fBovn\-controller\fR receives the updated \fBMAC_Binding\fR table from the OVN southbound database\[char46]  The next
packet destined to \fIA\fR through the logical router is sent
directly to the bound Ethernet address\[char46]
