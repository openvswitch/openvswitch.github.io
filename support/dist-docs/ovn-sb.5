ovn-sb \- OVN_Southbound database schema
.PP
This database holds logical and physical configuration and state for the
Open Virtual Network (OVN) system to support virtual network abstraction\[char46]
For an introduction to OVN, please see \fBovn\-architecture\fR(7)\[char46]
.PP
The OVN Southbound database sits at the center of the OVN
architecture\[char46]  It is the one component that speaks both southbound
directly to all the hypervisors and gateways, via
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR, and
northbound to the Cloud Management System, via \fBovn\-northd\fR:
.SS "Database Structure"
.PP
The OVN Southbound database contains three classes of data with
different properties, as described in the sections below\[char46]
.ST "Physical Network (PN) data"
.PP
PN tables contain information about the chassis nodes in the system\[char46]  This
contains all the information necessary to wire the overlay, such as IP
addresses, supported tunnel types, and security keys\[char46]
.PP
The amount of PN data is small (O(n) in the number of chassis) and it
changes infrequently, so it can be replicated to every chassis\[char46]
.PP
The \fBChassis\fR table comprises the PN tables\[char46]
.ST "Logical Network (LN) data"
.PP
LN tables contain the topology of logical switches and routers, ACLs,
firewall rules, and everything needed to describe how packets traverse a
logical network, represented as logical datapath flows (see Logical
Datapath Flows, below)\[char46]
.PP
LN data may be large (O(n) in the number of logical ports, ACL rules,
etc\[char46])\[char46]  Thus, to improve scaling, each chassis should receive only data
related to logical networks in which that chassis participates\[char46]  Past
experience shows that in the presence of large logical networks, even
finer-grained partitioning of data, e\[char46]g\[char46] designing logical flows so that
only the chassis hosting a logical port needs related flows, pays off
scale-wise\[char46]  (This is not necessary initially but it is worth bearing in
mind in the design\[char46])
.PP
The LN is a slave of the cloud management system running northbound of OVN\[char46]
That CMS determines the entire OVN logical configuration and therefore the
LN\(cqs content at any given time is a deterministic function of the CMS\(cqs
configuration, although that happens indirectly via the
\fBOVN_Northbound\fR database and \fBovn\-northd\fR\[char46]
.PP
LN data is likely to change more quickly than PN data\[char46]  This is especially
true in a container environment where VMs are created and destroyed (and
therefore added to and deleted from logical switches) quickly\[char46]
.PP
\fBLogical_Flow\fR and \fBMulticast_Group\fR contain LN
data\[char46]
.ST "Bindings data"
.PP
Bindings data link logical and physical components\[char46]  They show the current
placement of logical components (such as VMs and VIFs) onto chassis, and
map logical entities to the values that represent them in tunnel
encapsulations\[char46]
.PP
Bindings change frequently, at least every time a VM powers up or down
or migrates, and especially quickly in a container environment\[char46]  The
amount of data per VM (or VIF) is small\[char46]
.PP
Each chassis is authoritative about the VMs and VIFs that it hosts at any
given time and can efficiently flood that state to a central location, so
the consistency needs are minimal\[char46]
.PP
The \fBPort_Binding\fR and \fBDatapath_Binding\fR tables
contain binding data\[char46]
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
Some tables contain a special column named \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46]  This
column has the same form and purpose each place that it appears, so we
describe it here to save space later\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by the software that manages the OVN Southbound
database rather than by
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR\[char46]  In
particular, \fBovn\-northd\fR can use key-value pairs in this
column to relate entities in the southbound database to higher-level
entities (such as entities in the OVN Northbound database)\[char46]  Individual
key-value pairs in this column may be documented in some cases to aid
in understanding and troubleshooting, but the reader should not mistake
such documentation as comprehensive\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

Each row in this table represents a hypervisor or gateway (a chassis) in
the physical network (PN)\[char46]  Each chassis, via
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR, adds

When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should remove its own row\[char46]
(This is not critical because resources hosted on the chassis are equally
unreachable regardless of whether the row is present\[char46])  If a chassis
shuts down permanently without removing its row, some kind of manual or
automatic cleanup is eventually needed; we can devise a process for that
as necessary\[char46]

Each row in this table represents one logical flow\[char46]

that implement the L2 and L3 topologies specified in the
\fBOVN_Northbound\fR database\[char46]  Each hypervisor, via
\fBovn\-controller\fR, translates the logical flows into
OpenFlow flows specific to its hypervisor and installs them into
Open vSwitch\[char46]
.PP
Logical flows are expressed in an OVN-specific format, described here\[char46]  A
logical datapath flow is much like an OpenFlow flow, except that the
flows are written in terms of logical ports and logical datapaths instead
of physical ports and physical datapaths\[char46]  Translation between logical
and physical flows helps to ensure isolation between logical datapaths\[char46]
(The logical flow abstraction also allows the OVN centralized
components to do less work, since they do not have to separately
compute and push out physical flows to each chassis\[char46])
.PP
The default action when no flow matches is to drop packets\[char46]
.PP
\fBArchitectural Logical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR
.PP
This following description focuses on the life cycle of a packet through
a logical datapath, ignoring physical details of the implementation\[char46]
Please refer to \fBArchitectural Physical Life Cycle of a Packet\fR in
\fBovn\-architecture\fR(7) for the physical information\[char46]
.PP
The description here is written as if OVN itself executes these steps,
but in fact OVN (that is, \fBovn\-controller\fR) programs Open
vSwitch, via OpenFlow and OVSDB, to execute them on its behalf\[char46]
.PP
At a high level, OVN passes each packet through the logical datapath\(cqs
logical ingress pipeline, which may output the packet to one or more
logical port or logical multicast groups\[char46]  For each such logical output
port, OVN passes the packet through the datapath\(cqs logical egress
pipeline, which may either drop the packet or deliver it to the
destination\[char46]  Between the two pipelines, outputs to logical multicast
groups are expanded into logical ports, so that the egress pipeline only
processes a single logical output port at a time\[char46]  Between the two
pipelines is also where, when necessary, OVN encapsulates a packet in a
tunnel (or tunnels) to transmit to remote hypervisors\[char46]
.PP
In more detail, to start, OVN searches the \fBLogical_Flow\fR
table for a row with correct \fBlogical_datapath\fR, a \fBpipeline\fR of \fBingress\fR, a \fBtable_id\fR
of 0, and a \fBmatch\fR that is true for the packet\[char46]  If none
is found, OVN drops the packet\[char46]  If OVN finds more than one, it chooses
the match with the highest \fBpriority\fR\[char46]  Then OVN executes
each of the actions specified in the row\(cqs \fBactions\fR column,
in the order specified\[char46]  Some actions, such as those to modify packet
headers, require no further details\[char46]  The \fBnext\fR and
\fBoutput\fR actions are special\[char46]
.PP
The \fBnext\fR action causes the above process to be repeated
recursively, except that OVN searches for \fBtable_id\fR of 1
instead of 0\[char46]  Similarly, any \fBnext\fR action in a row found in
that table would cause a further search for a \fBtable_id\fR of
2, and so on\[char46]  When recursive processing completes, flow control returns
to the action following \fBnext\fR\[char46]
.PP
The \fBoutput\fR action also introduces recursion\[char46]  Its effect
depends on the current value of the \fBoutport\fR field\[char46]  Suppose
\fBoutport\fR designates a logical port\[char46]  First, OVN compares
\fBinport\fR to \fBoutport\fR; if they are equal, it treats
the \fBoutput\fR as a no-op\[char46]  In the common case, where they are
different, the packet enters the egress pipeline\[char46]  This transition to the
egress pipeline discards register data, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBreg0\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46]
\fBreg4\fR and connection tracking state, to achieve
uniform behavior regardless of whether the egress pipeline is on a
different hypervisor (because registers aren\(cqt preserve across
tunnel encapsulation)\[char46]
.PP
To execute the egress pipeline, OVN again searches the \fBLogical_Flow\fR table for a row with correct \fBlogical_datapath\fR, a \fBtable_id\fR of 0, a \fBmatch\fR that is true for the packet, but now looking for a \fBpipeline\fR of \fBegress\fR\[char46]  If no matching row is found,
the output becomes a no-op\[char46]  Otherwise, OVN executes the actions for the
matching flow (which is chosen from multiple, if necessary, as already
described)\[char46]
.PP
In the \fBegress\fR pipeline, the \fBnext\fR action acts as
already described, except that it, of course, searches for
\fBegress\fR flows\[char46]  The \fBoutput\fR action, however, now
directly outputs the packet to the output port (which is now fixed,
because \fBoutport\fR is read-only within the egress pipeline)\[char46]
.PP
The description earlier assumed that \fBoutport\fR referred to a
logical port\[char46]  If it instead designates a logical multicast group, then
the description above still applies, with the addition of fan-out from
the logical multicast group to each logical port in the group\[char46]  For each
member of the group, OVN executes the logical pipeline as described, with
the logical output port replaced by the group member\[char46]
.PP
\fBPipeline Stages\fR
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR is responsible for populating the
\fBLogical_Flow\fR table, so the stages are an
implementation detail and subject to change\[char46]  This section

expression\[char46]  Predicates may be used much like 1-bit fields\[char46]  For
example, \fBip4\fR might expand to \fBeth\[char46]type ==
0x800\fR\[char46]  Predicates are provided for syntactic convenience,
because it is always possible to instead specify the underlying
expression directly\[char46]
.IP
A predicate whose expansion refers to any nominal field or
predicate (see \fBLevel of Measurement\fR, below) is nominal;
other predicates have Boolean level of measurement\[char46]

.IP
\fBLevel of Measurement\fR\[char46]  See
http://en\[char46]wikipedia\[char46]org/wiki/Level_of_measurement for the statistical
concept on which this classification is based\[char46]  There are three
levels:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fIOrdinal\fR\[char46]  In statistics, ordinal values can be ordered
on a scale\[char46]  OVN considers a field (or subfield) to be ordinal if
its bits can be examined individually\[char46]  This is true for the
OpenFlow fields that OpenFlow or Open vSwitch makes ``maskable\[char46]\(cq\(cq
.IP
Any use of a nominal field may specify a single bit or a range of
bits, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]tci[13\[char46]\[char46]15]\fR refers to the PCP field
within the VLAN TCI, and \fBeth\[char46]dst[40]\fR refers to the
multicast bit in the Ethernet destination address\[char46]
.IP
OVN supports all the usual arithmetic relations (\fB==\fR,
\fB!=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR,
\fB>\fR, and \fB>=\fR) on ordinal fields and
their subfields, because OVN can implement these in OpenFlow and
Open vSwitch as collections of bitwise tests\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fINominal\fR\[char46]  In statistics, nominal values cannot be
usefully compared except for equality\[char46]  This is true of OpenFlow
port numbers, Ethernet types, and IP protocols are examples: all of
these are just identifiers assigned arbitrarily with no deeper
meaning\[char46]  In OpenFlow and Open vSwitch, bits in these fields
generally aren\(cqt individually addressable\[char46]
.IP
OVN only supports arithmetic tests for equality on nominal fields,
because OpenFlow and Open vSwitch provide no way for a flow to
efficiently implement other comparisons on them\[char46]  (A test for
inequality can be sort of built out of two flows with different
priorities, but OVN matching expressions always generate flows with
a single priority\[char46])
.IP
String fields are always nominal\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fIBoolean\fR\[char46]  A nominal field that has only two values, 0
and 1, is somewhat exceptional, since it is easy to support both
equality and inequality tests on such a field: either one can be
implemented as a test for 0 or 1\[char46]
.IP
Only predicates (see above) have a Boolean level of measurement\[char46]
.IP
This isn\(cqt a standard level of measurement\[char46]
.RE
.IP
\fBPrerequisites\fR\[char46]  Any symbol can have prerequisites, which are
additional condition implied by the use of the symbol\[char46]  For example,
For example, \fBicmp4\[char46]type\fR symbol might have prerequisite
\fBicmp4\fR, which would cause an expression \fBicmp4\[char46]type ==
0\fR to be interpreted as \fBicmp4\[char46]type == 0 &&
icmp4\fR, which would in turn expand to \fBicmp4\[char46]type == 0
&& eth\[char46]type == 0x800 && ip4\[char46]proto == 1\fR (assuming
\fBicmp4\fR is a predicate defined as suggested under
\fBTypes\fR above)\[char46]
.IP
\fBRelational operators\fR
.IP
All of the standard relational operators \fB==\fR,
\fB!=\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR,
\fB>\fR, and \fB>=\fR are supported\[char46]  Nominal
fields support only \fB==\fR and \fB!=\fR, and only in a
positive sense when outer \fB!\fR are taken into account,
e\[char46]g\[char46] given string field \fBinport\fR, \fBinport ==
\(dqeth0\(dq\fR and \fB!(inport != \(dqeth0\(dq)\fR are acceptable, but
not \fBinport != \(dqeth0\(dq\fR\[char46]
.IP
The implementation of \fB==\fR (or \fB!=\fR when it is
negated), is more efficient than that of the other relational
operators\[char46]
.IP
\fBConstants\fR
.IP
Integer constants may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal prefixed by
\fB0x\fR, or as dotted-quad IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses in
their standard forms, or Ethernet addresses as colon-separated hex
digits\[char46]  A constant in any of these forms may be followed by a slash
and a second constant (the mask) in the same form, to form a masked
constant\[char46]  IPv4 and IPv6 masks may be given as integers, to express
CIDR prefixes\[char46]
.IP
String constants have the same syntax as quoted strings in JSON (thus,
they are Unicode strings)\[char46]
.IP
Some operators support sets of constants written inside curly braces
\fB{\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] \fB}\fR\[char46]  Commas between elements of a set,
and after the last elements, are optional\[char46]  With \fB==\fR,
``\fB\fIfield\fB == { \fIconstant1\fB,
\fIconstant2\fB,\fR \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] \fB}\fR\(cq\(cq is syntactic sugar
for ``\fB\fIfield\fB == \fIconstant1\fB ||
\fIfield\fB == \fIconstant2\fB || \fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]\fB\fR\[char46]
Similarly, ``\fB\fIfield\fB != { \fIconstant1\fB,
\fIconstant2\fB, \fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]\fB }\fR\(cq\(cq is equivalent to
``\fB\fIfield\fB != \fIconstant1\fB &&
\fIfield\fB != \fIconstant2\fB &&
\fR\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]\fB\fR\(cq\(cq\[char46]
.IP
\fBMiscellaneous\fR
.IP
Comparisons may name the symbol or the constant first,
e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBtcp\[char46]src == 80\fR and \fB80 == tcp\[char46]src\fR are both
acceptable\[char46]
.IP
Tests for a range may be expressed using a syntax like \fB1024 <=
tcp\[char46]src <= 49151\fR, which is equivalent to \fB1024 <=
tcp\[char46]src && tcp\[char46]src <= 49151\fR\[char46]
.IP
For a one-bit field or predicate, a mention of its name is equivalent
to \fB\fIsymobl\fB == 1\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]present\fR
is equivalent to \fBvlan\[char46]present == 1\fR\[char46]  The same is true for
one-bit subfields, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]tci[12]\fR\[char46]  There is no
technical limitation to implementing the same for ordinal fields of all
widths, but the implementation is expensive enough that the syntax
parser requires writing an explicit comparison against zero to make
mistakes less likely, e\[char46]g\[char46] in \fBtcp\[char46]src != 0\fR the comparison
against 0 is required\[char46]
.IP
\fBOperator precedence\fR is as shown below, from highest to lowest\[char46]
There are two exceptions where parentheses are required even though the
table would suggest that they are not: \fB&&\fR and
\fB||\fR require parentheses when used together, and
\fB!\fR requires parentheses when applied to a relational
expression\[char46]  Thus, in \fB(eth\[char46]type == 0x800 || eth\[char46]type == 0x86dd)
&& ip\[char46]proto == 6\fR or \fB!(arp\[char46]op == 1)\fR, the

Logical datapath actions, to be executed when the logical flow
represented by this row is the highest-priority match\[char46]
.IP
Actions share lexical syntax with the \fBmatch\fR column\[char46]  An
empty set of actions (or one that contains just white space or
comments), or a set of actions that consists of just
\fBdrop;\fR, causes the matched packets to be dropped\[char46]
Otherwise, the column should contain a sequence of actions, each
terminated by a semicolon\[char46]
.IP
The following actions are defined:
.RS
.TP
\fBoutput;\fR
In the ingress pipeline, this action executes the
\fBegress\fR pipeline as a subroutine\[char46]  If
\fBoutport\fR names a logical port, the egress pipeline
executes once; if it is a multicast group, the egress pipeline runs
once for each logical port in the group\[char46]
.IP
In the egress pipeline, this action performs the actual
output to the \fBoutport\fR logical port\[char46]  (In the egress
pipeline, \fBoutport\fR never names a multicast group\[char46])
.IP
Output to the input port is implicitly dropped, that is,
\fBoutput\fR becomes a no-op if \fBoutport\fR ==
\fBinport\fR\[char46]  Occasionally it may be useful to override
this behavior, e\[char46]g\[char46] to send an ARP reply to an ARP request; to do
so, use \fBinport = \(dq\(dq;\fR to set the logical input port to
an empty string (which should not be used as the name of any
logical port)\[char46]
.TP
\fBnext;\fR
.TQ .5in
\fBnext(\fItable\fB);\fR
Executes another logical datapath table as a subroutine\[char46]  By default,
the table after the current one is executed\[char46]  Specify
\fItable\fR to jump to a specific table in the same pipeline\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield\fB = \fIconstant\fB;\fR
Sets data or metadata field \fIfield\fR to constant value
\fIconstant\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBoutport = \(dqvif0\(dq;\fR to set the
logical output port\[char46]  To set only a subset of bits in a field,
specify a subfield for \fIfield\fR or a masked
\fIconstant\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] one may use \fBvlan\[char46]pcp[2] = 1;\fR
or \fBvlan\[char46]pcp = 4/4;\fR to set the most sigificant bit of
the VLAN PCP\[char46]
.IP
Assigning to a field with prerequisites implicitly adds those
prerequisites to \fBmatch\fR; thus, for example, a flow
that sets \fBtcp\[char46]dst\fR applies only to TCP flows,
regardless of whether its \fBmatch\fR mentions any TCP
field\[char46]
.IP
Not all fields are modifiable (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBeth\[char46]type\fR and

ip4\[char46]src;\fR copies \fBip4\[char46]src\fR into \fBreg0\fR\[char46]
To modify only a subset of a field\(cqs bits, specify a subfield for
\fIfield1\fR or \fIfield2\fR or both, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBvlan\[char46]pcp
= reg0[0\[char46]\[char46]2];\fR copies the least-significant bits of
\fBreg0\fR into the VLAN PCP\[char46]
.IP
\fIfield1\fR and \fIfield2\fR must be the same type,
either both string or both integer fields\[char46]  If they are both
integer fields, they must have the same width\[char46]
.IP
If \fIfield1\fR or \fIfield2\fR has prerequisites, they
are added implicitly to \fBmatch\fR\[char46]  It is possible to
write an assignment with contradictory prerequisites, such as
\fBip4\[char46]src = ip6\[char46]src[0\[char46]\[char46]31];\fR, but the contradiction means
that a logical flow with such an assignment will never be matched\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIfield1\fB <\-> \fIfield2\fB;\fR
Similar to \fB\fIfield1\fB = \fIfield2\fB;\fR
except that the two values are exchanged instead of copied\[char46]  Both
\fIfield1\fR and \fIfield2\fR must modifiable\[char46]
.TP
\fBip\[char46]ttl\-\-;\fR
Decrements the IPv4 or IPv6 TTL\[char46]  If this would make the TTL zero
or negative, then processing of the packet halts; no further
actions are processed\[char46]  (To properly handle such cases, a
higher-priority flow should match on
\fBip\[char46]ttl == {0, 1};\fR\[char46])

The tunnel key value to which the logical datapath is bound\[char46]
The \fBTunnel Encapsulation\fR section in
\fBovn\-architecture\fR(7) describes how tunnel keys are
constructed for each supported encapsulation\[char46]
.ST "OVN_Northbound Relationship:"
Each row in \fBDatapath_Binding\fR is associated with some
logical datapath\[char46]  \fBovn\-northd\fR uses these keys to track the
association of a logical datapath with concepts in the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : logical-switch\fR: optional string, containing an uuid"
For a logical datapath that represents a logical switch,
\fBovn\-northd\fR stores in this key the UUID of the
corresponding \fBLogical_Switch\fR row in
the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : logical-router\fR: optional string, containing an uuid"
For a logical datapath that represents a logical router,
\fBovn\-northd\fR stores in this key the UUID of the
corresponding \fBLogical_Router\fR row in
the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database\[char46]
.ST "Common Columns:"
The overall purpose of these columns is described under \fBCommon
Columns\fR at the beginning of this document\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs"
.bp
.SH "Port_Binding TABLE"
Most rows in this table identify the physical location of a logical port\[char46]
(The exceptions are logical patch ports, which do not have any physical
location\[char46])
.PP
For every \fBLogical_Port\fR record in \fBOVN_Northbound\fR
database, \fBovn\-northd\fR creates a record in this table\[char46]
\fBovn\-northd\fR populates and maintains every column except
the \fBchassis\fR column, which it leaves empty in new records\[char46]
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR
populates the \fBchassis\fR column for the records that
identify the logical ports that are located on its hypervisor/gateway,
which \fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR in
turn finds out by monitoring the local hypervisor\(cqs Open_vSwitch
database, which identifies logical ports via the conventions described
in \fBIntegrationGuide\[char46]md\fR\[char46]
.PP
When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should clean up the
\fBchassis\fR column that it previously had populated\[char46]
(This is not critical because resources hosted on the chassis are equally
unreachable regardless of whether their rows are present\[char46])  To handle the
case where a VM is shut down abruptly on one chassis, then brought up
again on a different one,
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR must
overwrite the \fBchassis\fR column with new information\[char46]

.SS "Details:
.ST "Core Features:"
.IP "\fBdatapath\fR: \fBDatapath_Binding\fR"
The logical datapath to which the logical port belongs\[char46]
.IP "\fBlogical_port\fR: string (must be unique within table)"
A logical port, taken from \fBname\fR in the OVN_Northbound database\(cqs \fBLogical_Port\fR table\[char46]  OVN does not
prescribe a particular format for the logical port ID\[char46]
.IP "\fBchassis\fR: optional weak reference to \fBChassis\fR"
The physical location of the logical port\[char46]  To successfully identify a
chassis, this column must be a \fBChassis\fR record\[char46]  This is
populated by
\fBovn\-controller\fR/\fBovn\-controller\-vtep\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBtunnel_key\fR: integer, in range 1 to 32,767"
A number that represents the logical port in the key (e\[char46]g\[char46] STT key or
Geneve TLV) field carried within tunnel protocol packets\[char46]
.IP
The tunnel ID must be unique within the scope of a logical datapath\[char46]
.IP "\fBmac\fR: set of strings"
The Ethernet address or addresses used as a source address on the
logical port, each in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR\[char46]
The string \fBunknown\fR is also allowed to indicate that the
logical port has an unknown set of (additional) source addresses\[char46]
.IP
A VM interface would ordinarily have a single Ethernet address\[char46]  A
gateway port might initially only have \fBunknown\fR, and then
add MAC addresses to the set as it learns new source addresses\[char46]
.IP "\fBtype\fR: string"
A type for this logical port\[char46]  Logical ports can be used to model other
types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch\[char46]  The following types
are defined:
.RS
.TP
(empty string)
VM (or VIF) interface\[char46]
.TP
\fBpatch\fR
One of a pair of logical ports that act as if connected by a patch
cable\[char46]  Useful for connecting two logical datapaths, e\[char46]g\[char46] to connect
a logical router to a logical switch or to another logical router\[char46]
.TP
\fBlocalnet\fR
A connection to a locally accessible network from each
\fBovn\-controller\fR instance\[char46]  A logical switch can only
have a single \fBlocalnet\fR port attached and at most one
regular logical port\[char46]  This is used to model direct connectivity to
an existing network\[char46]
.TP
\fBvtep\fR
A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway chassis\[char46]  In order to
get this port correctly recognized by the OVN controller, the \fBoptions\fR:\fBvtep\-physical\-switch\fR and \fBoptions\fR:\fBvtep\-logical\-switch\fR must also
be defined\[char46]
.RE
.ST "Patch Options:"
These options apply to logical ports with \fBtype\fR of
\fBpatch\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : peer\fR: optional string"
The \fBlogical_port\fR in the \fBPort_Binding\fR
record for the other side of the patch\[char46]  The named \fBlogical_port\fR must specify this \fBlogical_port\fR
in its own \fBpeer\fR option\[char46]  That is, the two patch logical
ports must have reversed \fBlogical_port\fR and
\fBpeer\fR values\[char46]
.ST "Localnet Options:"
These options apply to logical ports with \fBtype\fR of
\fBlocalnet\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : network_name\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46]  \fBovn\-controller\fR uses the configuration entry
\fBovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR to determine how to connect to this
network\[char46]  \fBovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR is a list of network names
mapped to a local OVS bridge that provides access to that network\[char46]  An
example of configuring \fBovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR would be:
.IP
.nf
\fB$ ovs\-vsctl set open \[char46] external\-ids:ovn\-bridge\-mappings=physnet1:br\-eth0,physnet2:br\-eth1
.fi
.IP
When a logical switch has a \fBlocalnet\fR port attached,
every chassis that may have a local vif attached to that logical
switch must have a bridge mapping configured to reach that
\fBlocalnet\fR\[char46]  Traffic that arrives on a
\fBlocalnet\fR port is never forwarded over a tunnel to
another chassis\[char46]
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
If set, indicates that the port represents a connection to a specific
VLAN on a locally accessible network\[char46] The VLAN ID is used to match
incoming traffic and is also added to outgoing traffic\[char46]
.ST "VTEP Options:"
These options apply to logical ports with \fBtype\fR of
\fBvtep\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : vtep-physical-switch\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46] The name of the VTEP gateway\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : vtep-logical-switch\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46]  A logical switch name connected by the VTEP gateway\[char46]  Must
be set when \fBtype\fR is \fBvtep\fR\[char46]
.ST "Nested Containers:"
These columns support containers nested within a VM\[char46]  Specifically,
they are used when \fBtype\fR is empty and \fBlogical_port\fR identifies the interface of a container spawned
inside a VM\[char46]  They are empty for containers or VMs that run directly on
a hypervisor\[char46]
.IP "\fBparent_port\fR: optional string"
This is taken from
\fBparent_name\fR
in the OVN_Northbound database\(cqs \fBLogical_Port\fR table\[char46]
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
Identifies the VLAN tag in the network traffic associated with that
container\(cqs network interface\[char46]
.IP
This column is used for a different purpose when \fBtype\fR
is \fBlocalnet\fR (see \fBLocalnet Options\fR, above)\[char46]
