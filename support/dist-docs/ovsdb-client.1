.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovsdb\-client\fR program is a command-line client for
interacting with a running \fBovsdb\-server\fR process.
Each command connects to an OVSDB server, which is
\fBunix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock\fR by default, or may be specified as
\fIserver\fR in one of the following forms:
.RS
.IP "\fBssl:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fR"
.IQ "\fBtcp:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fR"
The given SSL or plain TCP \fIport\fR on the host at the given
\fIip\fR, which must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in
IPv4 or IPv6 address format.  If \fIip\fR is an IPv6 address, then
wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e.g.: \fBssl:[::1]:6640\fR.  On
Linux, use \fB%\fIdevice\fR to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level
addresses, e.g. \fBssl:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653\fR.  For \fBssl\fR, the
\fB\-\-private\-key\fR, \fB\-\-certificate\fR, and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR
options are mandatory.
.
.IP "\fBunix:\fIfile\fR"
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named \fIfile\fR.
.IP
On Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is represented by a file
created in the path \fIfile\fR to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain
socket.
.IP "\fBpssl:\fIport\fR[\fB:\fIip\fR]"
.IQ "\fBptcp:\fIport\fR[\fB:\fIip\fR]"
Listen on the given SSL or TCP \fIport\fR for a connection.  By
default, connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) addresses, but specifying
\fIip\fR limits connections to those from the given \fIip\fR, either
IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If \fIip\fR is an IPv6 address, then wrap
\fIip\fR with square brackets, e.g.: \fBpssl:6640:[::1]\fR.  On Linux,
use \fB%\fIdevice\fR to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level
addresses, e.g. \fBpssl:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]\fR.  For \fBpssl\fR,
the \fB\-\-private\-key\fR, \fB\-\-certificate\fR, and
\fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR options are mandatory.
.
.IP "\fBpunix:\fIfile\fR"
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named \fIfile\fR for a
connection.
.IP
On Windows, listen on a local named pipe.  A file is created in the
path \fIfile\fR to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.
.RE
.PP
The default \fIdatabase\fR is \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR.
.
.SS "Commands"
The following commands are implemented:
.IP "\fBlist\-dbs \fR[\fIserver\fR]"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, retrieves the list of known databases, and
prints them one per line.  These database names are the ones that may
be used for \fIdatabase\fR in the following commands.
.
.IP "\fBget\-schema \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR]"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, retrieves the schema for \fIdatabase\fR, and
prints it in JSON format.
.
.IP "\fBget\-schema\-version\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR]"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, retrieves the schema for \fIdatabase\fR, and
prints its version number on stdout.  A schema version number has the form
\fIx\fB.\fIy\fB.\fIz\fR.  See \fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for
details.
.IP
Schema version numbers and Open vSwitch version numbers are
independent.
.IP
If \fIdatabase\fR was created before schema versioning was introduced,
then it will not have a version number and this command will print a
blank line.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-tables\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR]"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, retrieves the schema for \fIdatabase\fR, and
prints a table listing the name of each table
within the database.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-columns\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR] \fItable\fR"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, retrieves the schema for \fIdatabase\fR, and
prints a table listing the name and type of each
column.  If \fItable\fR is specified, only columns in that table are
listed; otherwise, the tables include columns in all tables.
.
.IP "\fBtransact\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fItransaction\fR"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, sends it the specified \fItransaction\fR,
which must be a JSON array containing one or more valid OVSDB
operations, and prints the received reply on stdout.
.
.IP "\fBdump\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR]\fR [\fItable \fR[\fIcolumn\fR...]]"
Connects to \fIserver\fR, retrieves all of the data in \fIdatabase\fR,
and prints it on stdout as a series of tables. If \fItable\fR is
specified, only that table is retrieved.  If at least one \fIcolumn\fR
is specified, only those columns are retrieved.
.
.IP "\fBmonitor\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR] \fItable\fR [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB,\fIcolumn\fR]...]..."
.IQ "\fBmonitor-cond\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR] \fIconditions\fR \fItable\fR [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB,\fIcolumn\fR]...]..."
Connects to \fIserver\fR and monitors the contents of rows that match conditions in
\fItable\fR in \fIdatabase\fR. By default, the initial contents of \fItable\fR are
printed, followed by each change as it occurs.  If conditions empty,
all rows will be monitored. If at least one \fIcolumn\fR is specified, only those
columns are monitored.  The following \fIcolumn\fR names have special meanings:
.RS
.IP "\fB!initial\fR"
Do not print the initial contents of the specified columns.
.IP "\fB!insert\fR"
Do not print newly inserted rows.
.IP "\fB!delete\fR"
Do not print deleted rows.
.IP "\fB!modify\fR"
Do not print modifications to existing rows.
.RE
.IP
Multiple [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB,\fIcolumn\fR]...] groups may be specified
as separate arguments, e.g. to apply different reporting parameters to
each group.  Whether multiple groups or only a single group is
specified, any given column may only be mentioned once on the command
line.
.IP
\fBconditions\fR is a JSON array of <condition> as defined in RFC 7047 5.1
with the following change: A condition can be either a 3-element JSON array
as deescribed in the RFC or a boolean value..
.IP
If \fB\-\-detach\fR is used with \fBmonitor\fR or \fBmonitor-cond\fR, then
\fBovsdb\-client\fR detaches after it has successfully received and
printed the initial contents of \fItable\fR.
.IP
The \fBmonitor\fR command uses RFC 7047 "monitor" method to open a monitor
session with the server. The \fBmonitor-cond\fR command uses RFC 7047
extension "monitor_cond" method. See \fBovsdb\-server\fR(1) for details.
.IP "\fBmonitor\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fR[\fIdatabase\fR] \fBALL\fR"
Connects to \fIserver\fR and monitors the contents of all tables in
\fIdatabase\fR.  Prints initial values and all kinds of changes to all
columns in the database.  The \fB\-\-detach\fR option causes
\fBovsdb\-client\fR to detach after it successfully receives and
prints the initial database contents.
.IP
The \fBmonitor\fR command uses RFC 7047 "monitor" method to open a monitor
session with the server.
.
.SH TESTING COMMANDS
The following commands are mostly of interest for testing the correctness
of the OVSDB server.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-client\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBlock\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fIlock\fR"
.IQ "\fBovsdb\-client\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBsteal\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fIlock\fR"
.IQ "\fBovsdb\-client\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fBunlock\fI \fR[\fIserver\fR] \fIlock\fR"
Connects to \fIserver\fR and issues corresponding RFC 7047 lock operations
on \fIlock\fR. Prints json reply or subsequent update messages.
The \fB\-\-detach\fR option causes \fBovsdb\-client\fR to detach after it
successfully receives and prints the initial reply.
.IP
When running with the \fB\-\-detach\fR option, \fBlock\fR, \fBsteal\fR,
\fBunlock\fR and \fBexit\fR commands can be issued by using
\fBovs-appctl\fR. \fBexit\fR command causes the \fBovsdb\-client\fR to
close its \fBovsdb\-server\fR connection before exit.
The \fBlock\fR, \fBsteal\fR and \fBunlock\fR commands can be used to
issue additional lock operations over the same \fBovsdb\-server\fR connection. All above commands take a single \fIlock\fR argument, which does not have
to be the same as the \fIlock\fR that \fBovsdb\-client\fR started with.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Output Formatting Options"
Much of the output from \fBovsdb\-client\fR is in the form of tables.
The following options controlling output formatting:
.
.ds TD (default)
.IP "\fB\-f \fIformat\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-format=\fIformat\fR"
Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of
\fIformat\fR are available:
.RS
.ie '\*(PN'ovsdb\-client' .IP "\fBtable\fR (default)"
.el                       .IP "\fBtable\fR"
2-D text tables with aligned columns.
.ie '\*(PN'ovsdb\-client' .IP "\fBlist\fR"
.el                       .IP "\fBlist\fR (default)"
A list with one column per line and rows separated by a blank line.
.IP "\fBhtml\fR"
HTML tables.
.IP "\fBcsv\fR"
Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.
.IP "\fBjson\fR"
JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a sequence of JSON
objects, each of which corresponds to one table.  Each JSON object has
the following members with the noted values:
.RS
.IP "\fBcaption\fR"
The table's caption.  This member is omitted if the table has no
caption.
.IP "\fBheadings\fR"
An array with one element per table column.  Each array element is a
string giving the corresponding column's heading.
.IP "\fBdata\fR"
An array with one element per table row.  Each element is also an
array with one element per table column.  The elements of this
second-level array are the cells that constitute the table.  Cells
that represent OVSDB data or data types are expressed in the format
described in the OVSDB specification; other cells are simply expressed
as text strings.
.RE
.RE
.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIformat\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-data=\fIformat\fR"
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless the table
format is set to \fBjson\fR, in which case \fBjson\fR formatting is
always used when formatting cells.  The following types of \fIformat\fR
are available:
.RS
.IP "\fBstring\fR (default)"
The simple format described in the \fBDatabase Values\fR
.ie '\*(PN'ovs\-vsctl' section below.
.el                    section of \fBovs\-vsctl\fR(8).
.IP "\fBbare\fR"
The simple format with punctuation stripped off: \fB[]\fR and \fB{}\fR
are omitted around sets, maps, and empty columns, items within sets
and maps are space-separated, and strings are never quoted.  This
format may be easier for scripts to parse.
.IP "\fBjson\fR"
The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.
.RE
.IP
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-headings\fR"
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in the
first row of table output.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-pretty\fR"
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as possible.  This
option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more readable
fashion.  Members of objects and elements of arrays are printed one
per line, with indentation.
.IP
This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is always printed
compactly.
.IP "\fB\-\-bare\fR"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-format=list \-\-data=bare \-\-no\-headings\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-timestamp\fR"
For the \fBmonitor\fR and \fBmonitor-cond\fR commands, add a timestamp to each
table update.  Most output formats add the timestamp on a line of its own
just above the table.  The JSON output format puts the timestamp in a
member of the top-level JSON object named \fBtime\fR.
.
.SS "Daemon Options"
The daemon options apply only to the \fBmonitor\fR and \fBmonitor-cond\fR commands.
With any other command, they have no effect.
.ds DD
.PP
The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR[\fB=\fIpidfile\fR]
Causes a file (by default, \fB\*(PN.pid\fR) to be created indicating
the PID of the running process.  If the \fIpidfile\fR argument is not
specified, or
if it does not begin with \fB/\fR, then it is created in
\fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR.
.IP
If \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, no pidfile is created.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is specified and the specified pidfile 
already exists and is locked by a running process, \fB\*(PN\fR refuses 
to start.  Specify \fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR to cause it to instead 
overwrite the pidfile.
.IP
When \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, this option has no effect.
.
.IP \fB\-\-detach\fR
Runs \fB\*(PN\fR as a background process.  The process forks, and in
the child it starts a new session, closes the standard file
descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging to the
console), and changes its current directory to the root (unless
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR is specified).  After the child completes its
initialization, the parent exits.  \*(DD
.
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\fR
Creates an additional process to monitor the \fB\*(PN\fR daemon.  If
the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error
(\fBSIGABRT\fR, \fBSIGALRM\fR, \fBSIGBUS\fR, \fBSIGFPE\fR,
\fBSIGILL\fR, \fBSIGPIPE\fR, \fBSIGSEGV\fR, \fBSIGXCPU\fR, or
\fBSIGXFSZ\fR) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it.  If
the daemon dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process exits.
.IP
This option is normally used with \fB\-\-detach\fR, but it also
functions without it.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR 
changes its current working directory to the root directory after it 
detaches.  Otherwise, invoking \fB\*(PN\fR from a carelessly chosen 
directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting the file 
system that holds that directory.
.IP
Specifying \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR suppresses this behavior, preventing
\fB\*(PN\fR from changing its current working directory.  This may be 
useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to write 
core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory 
is not a good directory to use.
.IP
This option has no effect when \fB\-\-detach\fR is not specified.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-self\-confinement\fR
By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with
files under well-know, at build-time whitelisted directories.  It
is better to stick with this default behavior and not to use this
flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon.
Note that in contrast to other access control implementations that
are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC),
self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon itself and
hence should not be considered as a full confinement strategy, but
instead should be viewed as an additional layer of security.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-user\fR
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to run as a different user specified in "user:group", thus
dropping most of the root privileges. Short forms "user" and ":group" are also
allowed, with current user or group are assumed respectively. Only daemons
started by the root user accepts this argument.
.IP
On Linux, daemons will be granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES
before dropping root privileges. Daemons that interact with a datapath,
such as \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR, will be granted two additional capabilities, namely
CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_RAW. The capability change will apply even if
new user is "root".
.IP
On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security reasons,
specifying this option will cause the daemon process not to start.
.SS "Logging Options"
.de IQ
.  br
.  ns
.  IP "\\$1"
..
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.  (If \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR closes
its standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
effect.)
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIdestination\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vFACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=FACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. \fIfacility\fR can be one of
\fBkern\fR, \fBuser\fR, \fBmail\fR, \fBdaemon\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBsyslog\fR,
\fBlpr\fR, \fBnews\fR, \fBuucp\fR, \fBclock\fR, \fBftp\fR, \fBntp\fR,

\fBlocal2\fR, \fBlocal3\fR, \fBlocal4\fR, \fBlocal5\fR, \fBlocal6\fR or
\fBlocal7\fR. If this option is not specified, \fBdaemon\fR is used as
the default for the local system syslog and \fBlocal0\fR is used while sending
a message to the target provided via the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-method=\fImethod\fR"
Specify \fImethod\fR how syslog messages should be sent to syslog daemon.
Following forms are supported:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBlibc\fR, use libc \fBsyslog()\fR function.  This is the default behavior.
Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over \fB/dev/log\fR
UNIX domain socket.
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fR\fR, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possible to
specify arbitrary message format with this option.  However,
\fBrsyslogd 8.9\fR and older versions use hard coded parser function anyway
that limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use arbitrary message
format with older \fBrsyslogd\fR versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
IP address instead.
.IP \(bu
\fBudp:\fIip\fR:\fIport\fR\fR, use UDP socket.  With this method it is
possible to use arbitrary message format also with older \fBrsyslogd\fR.
When sending syslog messages over UDP socket extra precaution needs to
be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be
interfering with local syslog traffic and there are some security
considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain
sockets.

may be the same certificate that SSL peers use to verify the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may
be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
.
.IP "\fB\-C none\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=none\fR"
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL peers.  This
introduces a security risk, because it means that certificates cannot
be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
When \fIcacert.pem\fR exists, this option has the same effect as
\fB\-C\fR or \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.  If it does not exist, then
\fB\*(PN\fR will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the
SSL peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM
file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection
and reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be
authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus
obtained.
.IP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.IP
This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as
part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol does not require
the server to send the CA certificate.
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-C\fR and
\fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.
.SS "SSL Connection Options"
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\-protocols=\fIprotocols\fR"
Specifies, in a comma- or space-delimited list, the SSL protocols
\fB\*(PN\fR will enable for SSL connections.  Supported
\fIprotocols\fR include \fBTLSv1\fR, \fBTLSv1.1\fR, and \fBTLSv1.2\fR.
Regardless of order, the highest protocol supported by both sides will
be chosen when making the connection.  The default when this option is
omitted is \fBTLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\-ciphers=\fIciphers\fR"
Specifies, in OpenSSL cipher string format, the ciphers \fB\*(PN\fR will 
support for SSL connections.  The default when this option is omitted is
\fBHIGH:!aNULL:!MD5\fR.
