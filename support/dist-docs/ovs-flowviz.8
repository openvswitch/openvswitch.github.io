.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBovs\-flowviz\fP helps visualize OpenFlow and datapath flow dumps in different
formats in order to make them more easily understood.
.sp
\fBovs\-flowviz\fP reads flows from \fBstdin\fP or from a \fIfile\fP specified by the
\fB\-\-input\fP option, filters them, highlights them, and finally outputs
them in one of the predefined \fIformat\fPs.

.TE
.SS Console format
.sp
The \fBconsole\fP format works for both OpenFlow and datapath flow types, and
prints flows in the terminal using the style determined by the \fB\-\-style\fP
option.
.sp
Arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-heat\-map
Color of the packet and byte counters to reflect their relative size.
The color gradient goes through the following colors:
blue (coldest, lowest), cyan, green, yellow, red (hottest, highest)
.sp
Note filtering is applied before the range is calculated.
.UNINDENT
.SS JSON format
.sp
The \fBjson\fP format works for both OpenFlow and datapath flow types, and prints
flows in JSON format. See the \fI\%JSON Syntax\fP section for more details.
.SS HTML format
.sp
The \fBhtml\fP format works for both OpenFlow and datapath flows, and prints
flows in an HTML table that offers some basic interactivity. OpenFlow flows
are sorted in tables and datapath flows are arranged in flow trees
(see \fI\%Datapath tree format\fP for more details).
.sp
Styles defined via Style Configuration File and selected via \fB\-\-style\fP option
also apply to the \fBhtml\fP format.
.SS OpenFlow cookie format
.sp
The OpenFlow \fBcookie\fP format is similar to the \fBconsole\fP format but
instead of arranging the flows by table, it arranges the flows by cookie.
.SS OpenFlow logic format
.sp
The OpenFlow \fBlogic\fP format helps visualize the logic structure of OpenFlow
pipelines by arranging flows into \fIlogical blocks\fP\&.
A logical block is a set of flows that have:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Same \fBpriority\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Match on the same fields (regardless of the match value and mask).
.IP \(bu 2
Execute the same actions (regardless of the actions’ arguments,
except for resubmit and output).
.IP \(bu 2
Optionally, the \fBcookie\fP can be included as part of the logical flow.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s,  \-\-show\-flows
Show all the flows under each logical block.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d,  \-\-ovn\-detrace
Use ovn\-detrace.py script to extract cookie information (implies ‘\-c’).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c,  \-\-cookie
Consider the cookie in the logical block.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ovn\-detrace\-path  <path>
Use an alternative path to search for ovn_detrace.py.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ovnnb\-db  <conn>
OVN NB database connection method (implies ‘\-d’).
Default: “unix:/var/run/ovn/ovnnb_db.sock”.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ovnsb\-db  <conn>
OVN SB database connection method (implies ‘\-d’).
Default: “unix:/var/run/ovn/ovnsb_db.sock”.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-o  <filter>,  \-\-ovn\-filter  <filter>
Specify the filter to be run on the ovn\-detrace information.
Syntax: python regular expression
(See \fI\%https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-heat\-map
Change the color of the packet and byte counters to reflect their relative
size. The color gradient goes through the following colors:
blue (coldest, lowest), cyan, green, yellow, red (hottest, highest)
.sp
Note filtering is applied before the range is calculated.
.UNINDENT
.SS Datapath tree format
.sp
The datapath \fBtree\fP format arranges datapath flows in a hierarchical tree.
The tree is comprised of blocks with the same \fBrecirc_id\fP and \fBin_port\fP\&.
Within those blocks, flows with the same action are combined. And matches
which are the same are omitted to reduce the visual noise.
.sp
When a flow’s actions includes the \fBrecirc()\fP action with a specific
\fBrecirc_id\fP, flows matching on that \fBrecirc_id\fP and the same \fBin_port\fP
are listed below. This is done recursively for all actions.
.sp
The result is a hierarchical representation that shows how actions are related
to each other via recirculation. Note that flows with a specific non\-zero
\fBrecirc_id\fP are listed below each group of flows that have a corresponding
\fBrecirc()\fP action. Therefore, the output contains duplicated flows and can be
verbose.
.sp
Filtering works in a slightly different way for datapath flow trees.
Unlike other formats where a filter simply removes non\-matching flows,
the output of a filtered datapath flow tree will show full sub\-trees
that contain at least one flow that satisfies the filter.
.sp
The \fBhtml\fP format prints this same tree as an interactive HTML table and
the \fBgraph\fP format shows the same tree as a graphviz graph.
.SS Datapath graph format
.sp
The datapath \fBgraph\fP generates a graphviz visual representation of the
same tree\-like flow hierarchy that the \fBtree\fP format prints.
.sp
Arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-html
Print the graphviz format as an svg image alongside an interactive HTML
table of flows.
.UNINDENT
.SH JSON SYNTAX
.sp
Printing a single\-file OpenFlow or datapath dump without PMD thread blocks in
\fBjson\fP format results in a list of JSON objects, each representing a flow.
.sp
This list can be found inside one or more levels of JSON dictionaries
if multiple files are processed (filename used as key) or if PMD thread blocks
are found in datapath flows (name of the thread used as key).
.sp
Each flow object includes the following keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBorig\fP
Original flow string.
.TP
\fBinfo\fP
Object with the flow information such as: cookie, duration, table,
n_packets, n_bytes, etc.
.TP
\fBmatch\fP
Object with the flow match.
For each match, the object contains a key\-value where the key is the name
of the match as defined in \fBovs\-fields(7)\fP and \fBovs\-ofctl(8)\fP, and the
value represents the match value. The way each value is represented depends
on its type. See \fI\%Value representation\fP\&.
.TP
\fBactions\fP
List of action objects.
Each action is represented by an JSON object that has one key and one value.
The key corresponds to the action name. The value represents the arguments
of the key. See \fI\%Action representation\fP\&.
.TP
\fBufid\fP
The UFID (datapath flows only).
.UNINDENT
.SS Value representation
.sp
Values are represented differently depending on their type:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Flags: The value of flags is \fBtrue\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Decimal / Hexadecimal: Represented by their integer value.
If they support masking, represented by a dictionary with two keys:
\fBvalue\fP contains the field value and \fBmask\fP contains the mask.
Both are integers.
.IP \(bu 2
Ethernet: Represented by a string: \fB{address}[/{mask}]\fP
.IP \(bu 2
IPv4 / IPv6: Represented by a string \fB{address}[/{mask}]\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Registers: Represented by a dictionary with three keys:
\fBfield\(ga\fP contains the field value (string), \fBstart\fP, and \fBend\fP
represent the first and last bit of the register value.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, the register
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
NXM_NX_REG10[0..15]

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Action representation
.sp
Actions are generally represented by an object that has a single key and
value. The key is the action name as defined \fBovs\-actions(7)\fP\&.
.sp
The value of actions that have no arguments (such as \fBdrop\fP) is
(boolean) \fBtrue\fP\&.
.sp
The value of actions that have a list of arguments (e.g:
\fBresubmit([port],[table],[ct])\fP) is an object that has the name of the
argument as key. The argument names for each action is defined in
ovs\-actions. For example, the action
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
resubmit(,10)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

        \(dqtable\(dq: 10
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The value of actions that have a key\-word list as arguments
(e.g: \fBct([argument])\fP) is an object whose keys correspond to the keys
defined in \fBovs\-actions(7)\fP\&. The way values are represented depends
on the type of the argument.
For example, the action
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ct(table=14,zone=NXM_NX_REG12[0..15],nat)
.ft P

        \(dqtable\(dq: 14,
        \(dqzone\(dq: {
            \(dqfield\(dq: \(dqNXM_NX_REG12\(dq,
            \(dqstart\(dq: 0,
            \(dqend\(dq: 15
        },
        \(dqnat\(dq: true
    }
}

.SH STYLE CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
The style configuration file is selected via the \fB\-\-config\fP option
and has INI syntax. It can define any number of styles to be used by both
\fBconsole\fP and \fBhtml\fP formats. Once defined in the configuration file,
formats are selected using the \fB\-\-style\fP option.
.sp
INI sections are used to define styles, \fB[styles.mystyle]\fP defines a style
called \fImystle\fP\&. Within a section styles can be defined as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[FORMAT].[PORTION].[SELECTOR].[ELEMENT] = [VALUE]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBFORMAT\fP
Either \fBconsole\fP or \fBhtml\fP
.TP
\fBPORTION\fP
Part of the key\-value the style applies to:
\fBkey\fP to indicate the key part of a key\-value, \fBvalue\fP to indicate
the value part of a key\-value, \fBflag\fP to indicate a single flag
or \fBdelim\fP to indicate delimiters such as parentheses, brackets, etc.
.TP
\fBSELECTOR\fP
Select the key\-value the style applies to:
\fBhighlighted\fP to indicate highlighted key\-values, \fBtype.<type>\fP
to indicate certain types such as \fBIPAddress\fP or \fBEthMask\fP or

Filter Syntax
*************

   [! | not ] {key}[[.subkey]...] [OPERATOR] {value})] [LOGICAL OPERATOR] ...

  Comparison operators:
      =   equality
      <   less than
      >   more than
      ~=  masking (valid for IP and Ethernet fields)

  Logical operators:
      !{expr}:  NOT
      {expr} && {expr}: AND
      {expr} || {expr}: OR

  Matches and flow metadata:
      To compare against a match or info field, use the field directly, e.g:
          priority=100
          n_bytes>10
      Use simple keywords for flags:
          tcp and ip_src=192.168.1.1

  Actions:
      Actions values might be dictionaries, use subkeys to access individual
      values, e.g:
          output.port=3
      Use simple keywords for flags
          drop

  Examples of valid filters:
      nw_addr~=192.168.1.1 && (tcp_dst=80 || tcp_dst=443)
      arp=true && !arp_tsa=192.168.1.1
