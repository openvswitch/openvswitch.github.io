.ST "Ingress Table 10: ARP/ND responder"
.PP
.PP
This table implements ARP/ND responder in a logical switch for known IPs\[char46] The advantage of the ARP responder flow is to limit ARP broadcasts by locally responding to ARP requests without the need to send to other hypervisors\[char46] One common case is when the inport is a logical port associated with a VIF and the broadcast is responded to on the local hypervisor rather than broadcast across the whole network and responded to by the destination VM\[char46] This behavior is proxy ARP\[char46]
.PP
.PP
ARP requests arrive from VMs from a logical switch inport of type default\[char46] For this case, the logical switch proxy ARP rules can be for other VMs or logical router ports\[char46] Logical switch proxy ARP rules may be programmed both for mac binding of IP addresses on other logical switch VIF ports (which are of the default logical switch port type, representing connectivity to VMs or containers), and for mac binding of IP addresses on logical switch router type ports, representing their logical router port peers\[char46] In order to support proxy ARP for logical router ports, an IP address must be configured on the logical switch router type port, with the same value as the peer logical router port\[char46] The configured MAC addresses must match as well\[char46] When a VM sends an ARP request for a distributed logical router port and if the peer router type port of the attached logical switch does not have an IP address configured, the ARP request will be broadcast on the logical switch\[char46] One of the copies of the ARP request will go through the logical switch router type port to the logical router datapath, where the logical router ARP responder will generate a reply\[char46] The MAC binding of a distributed logical router, once learned by an associated VM, is used for all that VM\(cqs communication needing routing\[char46] Hence, the action of a VM re-arping for the mac binding of the logical router port should be rare\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Logical switch ARP responder proxy ARP rules can also be hit when receiving ARP requests externally on a L2 gateway port\[char46] In this case, the hypervisor acting as an L2 gateway, responds to the ARP request on behalf of a destination VM\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Note that ARP requests received from \fBlocalnet\fR or \fBvtep\fR logical inports can either go directly to VMs, in which case the VM responds or can hit an ARP responder for a logical router port if the packet is used to resolve a logical router port next hop address\[char46] In either case, logical switch ARP responder rules will not be hit\[char46] It contains these logical flows:

Priority\-100 flows to skip the ARP responder if inport is of type \fBlocalnet\fR or \fBvtep\fR and advances directly to the next table\[char46] ARP requests sent to \fBlocalnet\fR or \fBvtep\fR ports can be received by multiple hypervisors\[char46] Now, because the same mac binding rules are downloaded to all hypervisors, each of the multiple hypervisors will respond\[char46] This will confuse L2 learning on the source of the ARP requests\[char46] ARP requests received on an inport of type \fBrouter\fR are not expected to hit any logical switch ARP responder flows\[char46] However, no skip flows are installed for these packets, as there would be some additional flow cost for this and the value appears limited\[char46]

In place of \fBnext;\fR, it would be reasonable to use \fBdrop;\fR for the flows\(cq actions\[char46] If everything is working as it is configured, then this would produce equivalent results, since no host should reply to the request\[char46] But ARPing for one\(cqs own IP address is intended to detect situations where the network is not working as configured, so dropping the request would frustrate that intent\[char46]
