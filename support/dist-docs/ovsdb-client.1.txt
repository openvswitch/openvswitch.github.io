DESCRIPTION
       The ovsdb-client program is a command-line client for interacting  with
       a running ovsdb-server process.  Each command connects to the specified
       OVSDB  server,  which  may  be  an  OVSDB  active or passive connection
       method, as described in ovsdb(7).  The default server is  unix:/usr/lo‐
       cal/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock    and    the   default   database   is
       Open_vSwitch.

       ovsdb-client supports the method1,method2,...,methodN syntax  described
       in  ovsdb(7)  for  connecting  to a cluster.  When this syntax is used,
       ovsdb-client tries the cluster members in random order until  it  finds
       the cluster leader.  Specify the --no-leader-only option to instead ac‐
       cept any server that is connected to the cluster.

       For  an  introduction  to OVSDB and its implementation in Open vSwitch,
       see ovsdb(7).

       The following sections describe the  commands  that  ovsdb-client  sup‐
       ports.

   Server-Level Commands
       Most  ovsdb-client commands work with an individual database, but these
       commands apply to an entire database server.

       list-dbs [server]
              Connects to server, retrieves the list of known  databases,  and
              prints  them  one  per  line.  These database names are the ones
              that other commands may use for database.

   Database Schema Commands
       These commands obtain the schema from a database and print it  or  part
       of it.

       get-schema [server] [database]
              Connects  to  server,  retrieves  the  schema  for database, and
              prints it in JSON format.

       list-tables [server] [database]
              Connects to server,  retrieves  the  schema  for  database,  and
              prints  a  table listing the name of each table within the data‐
              base.

       list-columns [server] [database] table
              Connects to server,  retrieves  the  schema  for  database,  and
              prints a table listing the name and type of each column.  If ta‐
              ble  is specified, only columns in that table are listed; other‐
              wise, the tables include columns in all tables.

   Database Version Management Commands
       An OVSDB schema has a schema version number, and an OVSDB database  em‐
       beds  a  particular  version of an OVSDB schema.  These version numbers
       take the form x.y.z, e.g. 1.2.3.  The OVSDB implementation does not en‐
       force a particular version numbering scheme, but schemas managed within
       the Open vSwitch project use  the  following  approach.   Whenever  the
       database  schema  is  changed  in  a  non-backward compatible way (e.g.
       deleting a column or a table), x is incremented (and y and z are  reset
       to  0).   When  the database schema is changed in a backward compatible
       way (e.g. adding a new column), y is incremented (and z is reset to 0).
       When the database schema is changed cosmetically (e.g. reindenting  its
       syntax), z is incremented.

       Some OVSDB databases and schemas, especially very old ones, do not have
       a version number.

       Schema  version  numbers  and Open vSwitch version numbers are indepen‐
       dent.

       These commands work with different versions of OVSDB schemas and  data‐
       bases.

       convert [server] schema
              Reads  an OVSDB schema in JSON format, as specified in the OVSDB
              specification, from schema, then connects to server and requests
              the server to convert the database whose name  is  specified  in
              schema to the schema also specified in schema.

              The  conversion  is  atomic,  consistent, isolated, and durable.
              Following the schema change, the server  notifies  clients  that
              use  the  set_db_change_aware RPC introduced in Open vSwitch 2.9
              and cancels their outstanding transactions  and  monitors.   The
              server  disconnects  other  clients, enabling them to notice the
              change when they reconnect.

              This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades'' on  a
              database's  schema.  The data in the database must be valid when
              interpreted under schema, with only one exception: data for  ta‐
              bles  and  columns  that  do  not  exist  in schema are ignored.
              Columns that exist in schema but not in the database are set  to
              their  default  values.   All  of  schema's constraints apply in
              full.

              Some uses of this command can  cause  unrecoverable  data  loss.
              For  example,  converting  a  database  from a schema that has a
              given column or table to one that does not will delete all  data
              in that column or table.  Back up critical databases before con‐
              verting them.

              This  command  works  with  clustered  and standalone databases.
              Standalone  databases  may  also  be  converted  (offline)  with
              ovsdb-tool's convert command.

       needs-conversion [server] schema
              Reads  the  schema  from schema, then connects to server and re‐
              quests the schema from the database whose name is  specified  in
              schema.   If  the two schemas are the same, prints no on stdout;
              if they differ, prints yes.

       get-schema-version [server] [database]
              Connects to server,  retrieves  the  schema  for  database,  and
              prints  its  version  number on stdout.  If database was created
              before schema versioning was introduced, then it will not have a
              version number and this command will print a blank line.

       get-schema-cksum [server] [database]
              Connects to server,  retrieves  the  schema  for  database,  and
              prints  its  checksum on stdout.  If database does not include a
              checksum, prints a blank line.

   Data Management Commands
       These commands read or modify the data in a database.

       transact [server] transaction
              Connects to server, sends it the  specified  transaction,  which
              must  be  a  JSON  array  appropriate for use as the params to a
              JSON-RPC transact request, and prints the received reply on std‐
              out.

       query [server] transaction
              This commands acts like a read-only  version  of  transact.   It
              connects  to  server,  sends it the specified transaction, which
              must be a JSON array appropriate for use  as  the  params  to  a
              JSON-RPC transact request, and prints the received reply on std‐
              out.   To  ensure that the transaction does not modify the data‐
              base, this command appends an abort operation to the set of  op‐
              erations  included in transaction before sending it to the data‐
              base, and then removes the abort result from the reply (if it is
              present).

       dump [server] [database] [table [column...]]
              Connects to server, retrieves all of the data in  database,  and
              prints  it  on  stdout as a series of tables. If table is speci‐
              fied, only that table is retrieved.  If at least one  column  is
              specified, only those columns are retrieved.

       backup [server] [database] > snapshot
              Connects  to server, retrieves a snapshot of the schema and data
              in database, and prints it on stdout  in  the  format  used  for
              OVSDB standalone and active-backup databases.  This is an appro‐
              priate  way  to back up any remote database.  The database snap‐
              shot that it outputs is suitable to be  served  up  directly  by
              ovsdb-server or used as the input to ovsdb-client restore.

              Another way to back up a standalone or active-backup database is
              to  copy  its database file, e.g. with cp.  This is safe even if
              the database is in use.

              The output does not include ephemeral columns, which  by  design
              do not survive across restarts of ovsdb-server.

       [--force] restore [server] [database] < snapshot
              Reads  snapshot,  which  must  be  a OVSDB standalone or active-
              backup  database  (possibly  but  not  necessarily  created   by
              ovsdb-client  backup).   Then, connects to server, verifies that
              database and snapshot have the same schema, then deletes all  of
              the  data in database and replaces it by snapshot.  The replace‐
              ment happens atomically, in a single transaction.

              UUIDs for rows in the restored database will differ  from  those
              in  snapshot,  because the OVSDB protocol does not allow clients
              to specify row UUIDs.  Another way to restore  a  standalone  or
              active-backup database, which does also restore row UUIDs, is to
              stop  the  server  or  servers, replace the database file by the
              snapshot, then restart  the  database.   Either  way,  ephemeral
              columns  are  not  restored, since by design they do not survive
              across restarts of ovsdb-server.

              Normally restore exits  with  a  failure  if  snapshot  and  the
              server's database have different schemas.  In such a case, it is
              a  good  idea  to  convert the database to the new schema before
              restoring, e.g. with ovsdb-client convert.  Use --force to  pro‐
              ceed  regardless  of  schema differences even though the restore
              might fail with an error or succeed with surprising results.

       monitor [server] [database] table [column[,column]...]...
       monitor-cond [server] [database] conditions table [column[,col‐
       umn]...]...
       monitor-cond-since [server] [database] [last-id] conditions table [col‐
       umn[,column]...]...
              Connects to server and monitors the contents of rows that  match
              conditions  in  table  in database. By default, the initial con‐
              tents of table are printed, followed by each change  as  it  oc‐
              curs.   If  conditions  empty, all rows will be monitored. If at
              least one column is specified, only those columns are monitored.
              The following column names have special meanings:

              !initial
                     Do not  print  the  initial  contents  of  the  specified
                     columns.

              !insert
                     Do not print newly inserted rows.

              !delete
                     Do not print deleted rows.

              !modify
                     Do not print modifications to existing rows.

              Multiple  [column[,column]...]  groups may be specified as sepa‐
              rate arguments, e.g. to apply different reporting parameters  to
              each  group.   Whether multiple groups or only a single group is
              specified, any given column may only be mentioned  once  on  the
              command line.

              conditions is a JSON array of <condition> as defined in RFC 7047
              5.1 with the following change: A condition can be either a 3-el‐
              ement JSON array as described in the RFC or a boolean value.

              If   --detach  is  used  with  monitor,  monitor-cond  or  moni‐
              tor-cond-since, then ovsdb-client detaches after it has success‐
              fully received and printed the initial contents of table.

              The monitor command uses RFC 7047 "monitor"  method  to  open  a
              monitor  session  with  the  server.  The monitor-cond and moni‐
              tor-cond-since commandls uses RFC 7047 extension  "monitor_cond"
              and  "monitor_cond_since"  methods.  See ovsdb-server(1) for de‐
              tails.

       monitor [server] [database] ALL
              Connects to server and monitors the contents of  all  tables  in
              database.  Prints initial values and all kinds of changes to all
              columns   in   the   database.    The   --detach  option  causes
              ovsdb-client to detach after it successfully receives and prints
              the initial database contents.

              The monitor command uses RFC 7047 "monitor"  method  to  open  a
              monitor session with the server.

       wait [server] database state
              Waits for database on server to enter a desired state, which may
              be one of:

              added  Waits until a database with the given name has been added
                     to server.

              connected
                     Waits until a database with the given name has been added
                     to  server.  Then, if database is clustered, additionally
                     waits until it has joined and connected to its cluster.

              removed
                     Waits until database has been removed from  the  database
                     server.   This can also be used to wait for a database to
                     complete leaving its cluster,  because  ovsdb-server  re‐
                     moves a database at that point.

              database  is mandatory for this command because it is often used
              to check for databases that have  not  yet  been  added  to  the
              server,  so  that  the ovsdb-client semantics of acting on a de‐
              fault database do not work.

              This command acts on a particular  database  server,  not  on  a
              cluster, so server must name a single server, not a comma-delim‐
              ited list of servers.

   Testing commands
       These  commands  are  mostly of interest for testing the correctness of
       the OVSDB server.

       lock [server] lock
       steal [server] lock
       unlock [server] lock
              Connects to server and issues corresponding RFC 7047 lock opera‐
              tions on lock. Prints json reply or subsequent update  messages.
              The  --detach option causes ovsdb-client to detach after it suc‐
              cessfully receives and prints the initial reply.

              When running with the --detach option, lock, steal,  unlock  and
              exit  commands  can  be issued by using ovs-appctl. exit command
              causes the ovsdb-client to close its ovsdb-server connection be‐
              fore exit.  The lock, steal and unlock commands can be  used  to
              issue additional lock operations over the same ovsdb-server con‐
              nection.  All  above commands take a single lock argument, which
              does not have to be the  same  as  the  lock  that  ovsdb-client
              started with.

OPTIONS
   Output Formatting Options
       Much  of  the  output  from ovsdb-client is in the form of tables.  The
       following options controlling output formatting:

       -f format
       --format=format
              Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of  for‐
              mat are available:

              table (default)
                     2-D text tables with aligned columns.

              list   A  list  with one column per line and rows separated by a
                     blank line.

              html   HTML tables.

              csv    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

              json   JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a  se‐
                     quence  of JSON objects, each of which corresponds to one
                     table.  Each JSON object has the following  members  with
                     the noted values:

                     caption
                            The  table's  caption.   This member is omitted if
                            the table has no caption.

                     headings
                            An array with one element per table column.   Each
                            array element is a string giving the corresponding
                            column's heading.

                     data   An array with one element per table row.  Each el‐
                            ement  is also an array with one element per table
                            column.  The elements of this  second-level  array
                            are  the  cells  that constitute the table.  Cells
                            that represent OVSDB data or data  types  are  ex‐
                            pressed in the format described in the OVSDB spec‐
                            ification;  other  cells  are  simply expressed as
                            text strings.

       -d format
       --data=format
              Sets the formatting for cells within output  tables  unless  the
              table  format  is  set to json, in which case json formatting is
              always used when formatting cells.  The following types of  for‐
              mat are available:

              string (default)
                     The  simple  format described in the Database Values sec‐
                     tion of ovs-vsctl(8).

              bare   The simple format with punctuation stripped off:  []  and
                     {}  are  omitted  around  sets,  maps, and empty columns,
                     items within  sets  and  maps  are  space-separated,  and
                     strings  are never quoted.  This format may be easier for
                     scripts to parse.

              json   The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

       --no-headings
              This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in
              the first row of table output.

       --pretty
              By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as  possible.
              This  option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more read‐
              able fashion.  Members of objects and  elements  of  arrays  are
              printed one per line, with indentation.

              This  option  does  not  affect  JSON in tables, which is always
              printed compactly.

       --bare Equivalent to --format=list --data=bare --no-headings.

       --max-column-width=n
              For table output only, limits the width of  any  column  in  the
              output  to  n columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to fit, as
              necessary.  Columns are always wide enough to display the column
              names, if the heading row is printed.

       --timestamp
              For the monitor, monitor-cond and  monitor-cond-since  commands,
              add  a  timestamp to each table update.  Most output formats add
              the timestamp on a line of its own just above  the  table.   The
              JSON  output  format  puts the timestamp in a member of the top-
              level JSON object named time.

       -t
       --timeout=secs
              Limits ovsdb-client runtime to approximately secs  seconds.   If
              the  timeout expires, ovsdb-client will exit with a SIGALRM sig‐
              nal.

   Daemon Options
       The daemon options apply only to the monitor,  monitor-cond  and  moni‐
       tor-cond-since commands.  With any other command, they have no effect.

       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       --pidfile[=pidfile]
              Causes a file (by default, ovsdb-client.pid) to be created indi‐
              cating  the PID of the running process.  If the pidfile argument
              is not specified, or if it does not begin with  /,  then  it  is
              created in /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch.

              If --pidfile is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       --overwrite-pidfile
              By  default,  when --pidfile is specified and the specified pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              ovsdb-client  refuses  to start.  Specify --overwrite-pidfile to
              cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When --pidfile is not specified, this option has no effect.

       --detach
              Runs ovsdb-client as a background process.  The  process  forks,
              and  in  the  child it starts a new session, closes the standard
              file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging
              to the console), and changes its current directory to  the  root
              (unless --no-chdir is specified).  After the child completes its
              initialization, the parent exits.

       --monitor
              Creates  an  additional process to monitor the ovsdb-client dae‐
              mon.  If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates  a  pro‐
              gramming  error  (SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIG‐
              PIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ)  then  the  monitor  process
              starts  a  new  copy of it.  If the daemon dies or exits for an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with --detach, but  it  also  func‐
              tions without it.

       --no-chdir
              By default, when --detach is specified, ovsdb-client changes its
              current  working  directory  to  the root directory after it de‐
              taches.  Otherwise, invoking ovsdb-client from a carelessly cho‐
              sen directory would prevent the  administrator  from  unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying   --no-chdir  suppresses  this  behavior,  preventing
              ovsdb-client from changing its current working directory.   This
              may  be useful for collecting core files, since it is common be‐
              havior to write core dumps into the  current  working  directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when --detach is not specified.

       --no-self-confinement
              By  default  daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with
              files under well-known directories determined during build.   It
              is  better  to  stick  with this default behavior and not to use
              this flag unless some other Access Control is  used  to  confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations  that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC
              or MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space  daemon
              itself  and hence should not be considered as a full confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       --user Causes ovsdb-client to run as  a  different  user  specified  in
              "user:group",  thus  dropping most of the root privileges. Short
              forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with current user or
              group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started by the root
              user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES  before  dropping root privileges. Daemons
              that interact with a datapath, such  as  ovs-vswitchd,  will  be
              granted  three  additional  capabilities,  namely CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST and CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability  change  will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons,  specifying  this  option will cause the daemon process
              not to start.

   Logging Options
       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any spec, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and destination to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the  vlog/list  com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      syslog,  console,  or file, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.   (If  --detach  is specified, ovsdb-client
                     closes its standard file descriptors, so logging  to  the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On  Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  --syslog-target  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      off,  emer,  err,  warn, info, or dbg, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  off filters out all  messages.   See  ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for file, logging to a file
              will not take place unless --log-file is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  --ver‐
              bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:destination:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  destination  to pattern.  Refer to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       -vFACILITY:facility
       --verbose=FACILITY:facility
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message.  facility  can  be
              one  of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp,
              clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, local0,  local1,  local2,
              local3,  local4, local5, local6 or local7. If this option is not
              specified, daemon is used as the default for  the  local  system
              syslog  and local0 is used while sending a message to the target
              provided via the --syslog-target option.

       --log-file[=file]
              Enables logging to a file.  If file is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name  used  if  file  is  omitted  is   /usr/local/var/log/open‐
              vswitch/ovsdb-client.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP port on host, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The host must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

       --syslog-method=method
              Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      libc, use libc syslog() function.  Downside of using this
                     options  is  that libc adds fixed prefix to every message
                     before it is actually sent  to  the  syslog  daemon  over
                     /dev/log UNIX domain socket.

              •      unix:file, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However,  rsyslogd  8.9 and older versions use hard coded
                     parser function anyway that  limits  UNIX  domain  socket
                     use.   If  you  want to use arbitrary message format with
                     older rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      udp:ip:port, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible to use arbitrary message  format  also  with  older
                     rsyslogd.   When  sending syslog messages over UDP socket
                     extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for  ex‐
                     ample,  syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
                     the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could
                     be  interfering  with  local syslog traffic and there are
                     some security considerations that apply to  UDP  sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      null, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The  default  is  taken  from  the OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is libc.

   Public Key Infrastructure Options
       -p privkey.pem
       --private-key=privkey.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              ovsdb-client's identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.

       -c cert.pem
       --certificate=cert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on -p or --private-key to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

       -C cacert.pem
       --ca-cert=cacert.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              ovsdb-client  should  use to verify certificates presented to it
              by SSL/TLS peers.   (This  may  be  the  same  certificate  that
              SSL/TLS  peers  use to verify the certificate specified on -c or
              --certificate, or it may be a different one,  depending  on  the
              PKI design in use.)

       -C none
       --ca-cert=none
              Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it  means  that
              certificates  cannot  be  verified  to be those of known trusted
              hosts.

       --bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
              When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as -C or
              --ca-cert.  If it does not exist, then ovsdb-client will attempt
              to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL/TLS peer on its  first
              SSL/TLS  connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is
              successful, it will immediately drop the connection  and  recon‐
              nect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be authenti‐
              cated  by  a  certificate  signed by the CA certificate thus ob‐
              tained.

              This option exposes the SSL/TLS connection to a  man-in-the-mid‐
              dle  attack  obtaining the initial CA certificate, but it may be
              useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA cer‐
              tificate as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS pro‐
              tocols do not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.

   SSL/TLS Connection Options
       --ssl-protocols=protocols
              Specifies a range or a comma- or  space-delimited  list  of  the
              SSL/TLS  protocols  ovsdb-client will enable for SSL/TLS connec‐
              tions.  Supported protocols include TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.  Ranges
              can be provided in a form of two protocol names separated with a
              dash, or as a single protocol name with a plus sign.  For  exam‐
              ple,  use  TLSv1.2-TLSv1.3  to  allow  TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.  Use
              TLSv1.2+ to allow TLSv1.2 and any later  protocol.   The  option
              accepts  a list of protocols or exactly one range.  The range is
              a preferred way of specifying protocols and  the  option  always
              behaves  as  if  the  range  between the minimum and the maximum
              specified version is provided, i.e., if the  option  is  set  to
              TLSv1.X,TLSv1.(X+2),  the TLSv1.(X+1) will also be enabled as if
              it was a range.  Regardless of order, the highest protocol  sup‐
              ported  by both sides will be chosen when making the connection.
              The default when this option is omitted is TLSv1.2 or later.

       --ssl-ciphers=ciphers
              Specifies,  in  OpenSSL  cipher  string  format,   the   ciphers
              ovsdb-client  will support for SSL/TLS connections with TLSv1.2.
              The default when this option is omitted is DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=2.

       --ssl-ciphersuites=ciphersuites
              Specifies, in OpenSSL ciphersuite  string  format,  the  cipher‐
              suites  ovsdb-client  will  support for SSL/TLS connections with
              TLSv1.3 and later.  Default value from OpenSSL will be used when
              this option is omitted.

   Other Options
       --record[=directory]
              Sets the process in "recording" mode, in which  it  will  record
              all  the connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network
              sockets) and some other important necessary bits, so they  could
              be  replayed  later.  Recorded data is stored in replay files in
              specified directory.  If directory does not begin with /, it  is
              interpreted  as  relative to /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch.  If
              directory is not specified, /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch  will
              be used.

       --replay[=directory]
              Sets  the process in "replay" mode, in which it will read infor‐
              mation about connections, data from  streams  (Unix  domain  and
              network sockets) and some other necessary bits directly from re‐
              play files instead of using real sockets.  Replay files from the
              directory  will be used.  If directory does not begin with /, it
