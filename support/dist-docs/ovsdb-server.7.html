<u>OVSDB-SERVER</u>(7)                  Open vSwitch                  <u>OVSDB-SERVER</u>(7)

<b>NAME</b>
       ovsdb-server - Open vSwitch Database Server Protocol

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>  implements  the  Open  vSwitch  Database (OVSDB) protocol
       specified in RFC 7047.  This document provides clarifications  for  how
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>  implements the protocol and describes the extensions that
       it provides beyond RFC 7047.  Numbers in section headings refer to cor‐
       responding sections in RFC 7047.

   <b>3.1</b> <b>JSON</b> <b>Usage</b>
       RFC 4627 says that names within a JSON object should  be  unique.   The
       Open  vSwitch  JSON  parser  discards all but the last value for a name
       that is specified more than once.

       The definition of &lt;error&gt; allows for implementation  extensions.   Cur‐
       rently  <b>ovsdb-server</b> uses the following additional <b>error</b> strings (which
       might change in later releases):

       <b>syntax</b> <b>error</b> <b>or</b> <b>unknown</b> <b>column</b>
              The request could not be parsed as an OVSDB request.   An  addi‐
              tional  <b>syntax</b>  member,  whose  value  is a string that contains
              JSON, may narrow down the particular syntax that  could  not  be
              parsed.

       <b>internal</b> <b>error</b>
              The request triggered a bug in <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       <b>ovsdb</b> <b>error</b>
              A map or set contains a duplicate key.

       <b>permission</b> <b>error</b>
              The  request  was denied by the role-based access control exten‐
              sion, introduced in version 2.8.

   <b>3.2</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>Format</b>
       RFC 7047 requires the <b>version</b> field in &lt;database-schema&gt;.  Current ver‐
       sions of <b>ovsdb-server</b> allow it  to  be  omitted  (future  versions  are
       likely to require it).

       RFC  7047  allows columns that contain weak references to be immutable.
       This raises the issue of the behavior of the weak  reference  when  the
       rows  that  it references are deleted.  Since version 2.6, <b>ovsdb-server</b>
       forces columns that contain weak references to be mutable.

       Since version 2.8, the table name <b>RBAC_Role</b> is used internally  by  the
       role-based  access  control extension to <b>ovsdb-server</b> and should not be
       used for purposes other than defining mappings of role names  to  table
       access  permissions.  This table has one row per role name and the fol‐
       lowing columns:

       <b>name</b>   The role name.

       <b>permissions</b>
              A map of table name to a reference to a row in a  separate  per‐
              mission table.

       The  separate RBAC permission table has one row per access control con‐
       figuration and the following columns:

       <b>name</b>   The name of the table to which the row applies.

       <b>authorization</b>
              The set of column names and column:key pairs to be compared with
              the client ID in order to determine the authorization status  of
              the requested operation.

       <b>insert_delete</b>
              A boolean value, true if authorized insertions and deletions are
              allowed, false if no insertions or deletions are allowed.

       <b>update</b> The set of columns and column:key pairs for which authorized up‐
              date and mutate operations should be permitted.

   <b>4</b> <b>Wire</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       The original OVSDB specifications included the following reasons, omit‐
       ted  from  RFC 7047, to operate JSON-RPC directly over a stream instead
       of over HTTP:

       • JSON-RPC is a peer-to-peer protocol, but HTTP is a client-server pro‐
         tocol, which is a poor match.  Thus, JSON-RPC over HTTP requires  the
         client to periodically poll the server to receive server requests.

       • HTTP  is more complicated than stream connections and doesn’t provide
         any corresponding advantage.

       • The JSON-RPC specification for HTTP transport is incomplete.

   <b>4.1.3</b> <b>Transact</b>
       Since version 2.8, role-based access controls can be applied to  opera‐
       tions  within a transaction that would modify the contents of the data‐
       base (these operations include row insert, row delete,  column  update,
       and  column  mutate).  Role-based  access controls are applied when the
       database schema contains a table with the name <b>RBAC_Role</b> and  the  con‐
       nection on which the transaction request was received has an associated
       role  name  (from the <b>role</b> column in the remote connection table). When
       role-based access controls are enabled, transactions that are otherwise
       well-formed may be rejected depending on the client’s role, ID, and the
       contents of the <b>RBAC_Role</b> table and associated permissions table.

   <b>4.1.5</b> <b>Monitor</b>
       For backward compatibility, <b>ovsdb-server</b>  currently  permits  a  single
       &lt;monitor-request&gt;  to  be  used instead of an array; it is treated as a
       single-element array.  Future versions  of  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  might  remove
       this compatibility feature.

       Because  the  &lt;json-value&gt; parameter is used to match subsequent update
       notifications (see below) to the request, it must be unique  among  all
       active  monitors.   <b>ovsdb-server</b> rejects attempt to create two monitors
       with the same identifier.

       When a given client sends a <b>transact</b> request that changes a table  that
       the same client is monitoring, <b>ovsdb-server</b> always sends the <b>update</b> (or
       <b>update2</b>  or <b>update3</b>) for these changes before it sends the reply to the
       <b>transact</b> request.  Thus, when a client receives a  <b>transact</b>  reply,  it
       can  know  immediately what changes (if any) the transaction made.  (If
       ovsdb-server might use the other order, then a client  that  wishes  to
       act on based on the results of its own transactions would not know when
       this was guaranteed to have taken place.)

   <b>4.1.7</b> <b>Monitor</b> <b>Cancellation</b>
       When  a database monitored by a session is removed, and database change
       awareness is enabled for the session (see Section 4.1.16), the database
       server spontaneously cancels all monitors (including conditional  moni‐
       tors  described  in Section 4.1.12) for the removed database.  For each
       canceled monitor, it issues a notification in the following form:

          "method": "monitor_canceled"
          "params": [&lt;json-value&gt;]
          "id": null

   <b>4.1.12</b> <b>Monitor_cond</b>
       A new monitor method added in Open  vSwitch  version  2.6.   The  <b>moni‐</b>
       <b>tor_cond</b> request enables a client to replicate subsets of tables within
       an OVSDB database by requesting notifications of changes to rows match‐
       ing one of the conditions specified in <b>where</b> by receiving the specified
       contents of these rows when table updates occur.  <b>monitor_cond</b> also al‐
       lows  a  more  efficient  update  notifications by receiving &lt;table-up‐
       dates2&gt; notifications (described below).

       The <b>monitor</b> method described in Section 4.1.5  also  applies  to  <b>moni‐</b>
       <b>tor_cond</b>, with the following exceptions:

       • RPC request method becomes <b>monitor_cond</b>.

       • Reply result follows &lt;table-updates2&gt;, described in Section 4.1.14.

       • Subsequent  changes  are sent to the client using the <b>update2</b> monitor
         notification, described in Section 4.1.14

       • Update notifications are being sent only for rows  matching  [&lt;condi‐
         tion&gt;*].

       The request object has the following members:

          "method": "monitor_cond"
          "params": [&lt;db-name&gt;, &lt;json-value&gt;, &lt;monitor-cond-requests&gt;]
          "id": &lt;nonnull-json-value&gt;

       The &lt;json-value&gt; parameter is used to match subsequent update notifica‐
       tions  (see below) to this request.  The &lt;monitor-cond-requests&gt; object
       maps the name of the table to an array of &lt;monitor-cond-request&gt;.

       Each &lt;monitor-cond-request&gt; is an object with the following members:

          "columns": [&lt;column&gt;*]            optional
          "where": [&lt;condition&gt;*]           optional
          "select": &lt;monitor-select&gt;        optional

       The <b>columns</b>, if present, define the columns within the table to be mon‐
       itored that match conditions.  If not present, all  columns  are  moni‐
       tored.

       The  <b>where</b>, if present, is a JSON array of &lt;condition&gt; and boolean val‐
       ues.  If not present or condition is an empty array, implicit True will
       be considered and updates on all rows will be sent.

       &lt;monitor-select&gt; is an object with the following members:

          "initial": &lt;boolean&gt;              optional
          "insert": &lt;boolean&gt;               optional
          "delete": &lt;boolean&gt;               optional
          "modify": &lt;boolean&gt;               optional

       The contents of this object specify how the columns or table are to  be
       monitored as explained in more detail below.

       The response object has the following members:

          "result": &lt;table-updates2&gt;
          "error": null
          "id": same "id" as request

       The  &lt;table-updates2&gt;  object is described in detail in Section 4.1.14.
       It contains the contents of the tables for which initial rows  are  se‐
       lected.  If no tables initial contents are requested, then <b>result</b> is an
       empty object.

       Subsequently,  when  changes to a specified table that match one of the
       conditions in &lt;monitor-cond-request&gt; are committed, the changes are au‐
       tomatically sent to the client using the <b>update2</b>  monitor  notification
       (see Section 4.1.14).  This monitoring persists until the JSON-RPC ses‐
       sion terminates or until the client sends a <b>monitor_cancel</b> JSON-RPC re‐
       quest.

       Each  &lt;monitor-cond-request&gt;  specifies  one or more conditions and the
       manner in which the rows that match the conditions are to be monitored.
       The circumstances in which an <b>update</b> notification is  sent  for  a  row
       within the table are determined by &lt;monitor-select&gt;:

       • If  <b>initial</b>  is omitted or true, every row in the original table that
         matches one of the conditions is sent as part of the response to  the
         <b>monitor_cond</b> request.

       • If  <b>insert</b> is omitted or true, update notifications are sent for rows
         newly inserted into the table that match conditions or for rows modi‐
         fied in the table so that their old version does not match the condi‐
         tion and new version does.

       • If <b>delete</b> is omitted or true, update notifications are sent for  rows
         deleted  from the table that match conditions or for rows modified in
         the table so that their old version does match the conditions and new
         version does not.

       • If <b>modify</b> is omitted or true, update notifications are sent  whenever
         a  row  in the table that matches conditions in both old and new ver‐
         sion is modified.

       Both <b>monitor</b> and <b>monitor_cond</b> sessions can exist concurrently. However,
       <b>monitor</b> and <b>monitor_cond</b> shares the same &lt;json-value&gt; parameter  space;
       it must be unique among all <b>monitor</b> and <b>monitor_cond</b> sessions.

   <b>4.1.13</b> <b>Monitor_cond_change</b>
       The  <b>monitor_cond_change</b> request enables a client to change an existing
       <b>monitor_cond</b> replication of the database by specifying a new  condition
       and  columns for each replicated table.  Currently changing the columns
       set is not supported.

       The request object has the following members:

          "method": "monitor_cond_change"
          "params": [&lt;json-value&gt;, &lt;json-value&gt;, &lt;monitor-cond-update-requests&gt;]
          "id": &lt;nonnull-json-value&gt;

       The &lt;json-value&gt; parameter should have a value of  an  existing  condi‐
       tional  monitoring session from this client. The second &lt;json-value&gt; in
       params array is the requested value for this  session.  This  value  is
       valid only after <b>monitor_cond_change</b> is committed. A user can use these
       values  to distinguish between update messages before conditions update
       and after. The &lt;monitor-cond-update-requests&gt; object maps the  name  of
       the  table to an array of &lt;monitor-cond-update-request&gt;.  Monitored ta‐
       bles not included in &lt;monitor-cond-update-requests&gt; retain  their  cur‐
       rent conditions.

       Each &lt;monitor-cond-update-request&gt; is an object with the following mem‐
       bers:

          "columns": [&lt;column&gt;*]         optional
          "where": [&lt;condition&gt;*]        optional

       The  <b>columns</b>  specify  a new array of columns to be monitored, although
       this feature is not yet supported.

       The <b>where</b> specify a new array of conditions to be applied to this moni‐
       toring session.

       The response object has the following members:

          "result": {}
          "error": null
          "id": same "id" as request

       Subsequent &lt;table-updates2&gt; notifications are described  in  detail  in
       Section  4.1.14 in the RFC.  If insert contents are requested by origi‐
       nal monitor_cond request, &lt;table-updates2&gt; will contain rows that match
       the new condition and do not match the old condition.  If deleted  con‐
       tents  are  requested  by origin monitor request, &lt;table-updates2&gt; will
       contain any matched rows by old condition and not matched  by  the  new
       condition.

       Changes  according  to the new conditions are automatically sent to the
       client using the <b>update2</b> or <b>update3</b> monitor notification  depending  on
       the  monitor  method.   An  update,  if any, as a result of a condition
       change, will be sent to the  client  before  the  reply  to  the  <b>moni‐</b>
       <b>tor_cond_change</b> request.

   <b>4.1.14</b> <b>Update2</b> <b>notification</b>
       The  <b>update2</b> notification is sent by the server to the client to report
       changes in tables that are being monitored following a <b>monitor_cond</b> re‐
       quest as described above. The notification has the following members:

          "method": "update2"
          "params": [&lt;json-value&gt;, &lt;table-updates2&gt;]
          "id": null

       The &lt;json-value&gt; in <b>params</b> is the same  as  the  value  passed  as  the
       &lt;json-value&gt;  in  <b>params</b>  for  the corresponding <b>monitor</b> request.  &lt;ta‐
       ble-updates2&gt; is an object that maps from a table name to a  &lt;table-up‐
       date2&gt;.   A &lt;table-update2&gt; is an object that maps from row’s UUID to a
       &lt;row-update2&gt; object. A &lt;row-update2&gt; is an object with one of the fol‐
       lowing members:

       <b>"initial":</b> <b>&lt;row&gt;</b>
              present for <b>initial</b> updates

       <b>"insert":</b> <b>&lt;row&gt;</b>
              present for <b>insert</b> updates

       <b>"delete":</b> <b>&lt;row&gt;</b>
              present for <b>delete</b> updates

       <b>"modify":</b> <b>&lt;row&gt;"</b>
              present for <b>modify</b> updates

       The format of &lt;row&gt; is described in Section 5.1.

       &lt;row&gt; is always a null object for a <b>delete</b> update.  In <b>initial</b> and  <b>in‐</b>
       <b>sert</b>  updates, &lt;row&gt; omits columns whose values equal the default value
       of the column type.

       For a <b>modify</b> update, &lt;row&gt; contains only the columns that are modified.
       &lt;row&gt; stores the difference between the old and  new  value  for  those
       columns, as described below.

       For  columns  with single value, the difference is the value of the new
       column.

       The difference between two sets are all elements that  only  belong  to
       one of the sets.

       The  difference between two maps are all key-value pairs whose keys ap‐
       pears in only one of the maps, plus the key-value pairs whose keys  ap‐
       pear  in both maps but with different values.  For the latter elements,
       &lt;row&gt; includes the value from the new column.

       Initial views of rows are not presented in update2  notifications,  but
       in  the response object to the <b>monitor_cond</b> request.  The formatting of
       the &lt;table-updates2&gt; object, however, is the same in either case.

   <b>4.1.15</b> <b>Monitor_cond_since</b>
       A new monitor method added in Open vSwitch  version  2.12.   The  <b>moni‐</b>
       <b>tor_cond_since</b>  request  enables  a client to request changes that hap‐
       pened after a specific transaction id. A client can use this feature to
       request only latest changes after a server connection reset instead  of
       re-transfer all data from the server again.

       The  <b>monitor_cond</b>  method  described  in Section 4.1.12 also applies to
       <b>monitor_cond_since</b>, with the following exceptions:

       • RPC request method becomes <b>monitor_cond_since</b>.

       • Reply result includes extra parameters.

       • Subsequent changes are sent to the client using the  <b>update3</b>  monitor
         notification, described in Section 4.1.16

       The request object has the following members:

          "method": "monitor_cond_since"
          "params": [&lt;db-name&gt;, &lt;json-value&gt;, &lt;monitor-cond-requests&gt;, &lt;last-txn-id&gt;]
          "id": &lt;nonnull-json-value&gt;

       The  &lt;last-txn-id&gt;  parameter is the transaction id that identifies the
       latest data the client already has, and  it  requests  server  to  send
       changes AFTER this transaction (exclusive).

       All other parameters are the same as <b>monitor_cond</b> method.

       The response object has the following members:

          "result": [&lt;found&gt;, &lt;last-txn-id&gt;, &lt;table-updates2&gt;]
          "error": null
          "id": same "id" as request

       The  &lt;found&gt;  is  a  boolean  value that tells if the &lt;last-txn-id&gt; re‐
       quested by client is found in server’s history or  not.  If  true,  the
       changes  after  that version up to current is sent. Otherwise, all data
       is sent.

       The &lt;last-txn-id&gt; is the transaction  id  that  identifies  the  latest
       transaction  included  in  the  changes in &lt;table-updates2&gt; of this re‐
       sponse, so that client can keep tracking.  If there is  no  change  in‐
       volved in this response, it is the same as the &lt;last-txn-id&gt; in the re‐
       quest  if  &lt;found&gt;  is  true, or zero uuid if &lt;found&gt; is false.  If the
       server does not support transaction uuid, it will be zero uuid as well.

       All other parameters are the same as in response object of <b>monitor_cond</b>
       method.

       Like in <b>monitor_cond</b>, subsequent changes that match conditions in &lt;mon‐
       itor-cond-request&gt; are automatically sent to the client, but using  <b>up‐</b>
       <b>date3</b> monitor notification (see Section 4.1.16), instead of <b>update2</b>.

   <b>4.1.16</b> <b>Update3</b> <b>notification</b>
       The  <b>update3</b> notification is sent by the server to the client to report
       changes  in  tables  that  are  being  monitored  following   a   <b>moni‐</b>
       <b>tor_cond_since</b>  request  as  described  above. The notification has the
       following members:

          "method": "update3"
          "params": [&lt;json-value&gt;, &lt;last-txn-id&gt;, &lt;table-updates2&gt;]
          "id": null

       The &lt;last-txn-id&gt; is the same as described in the  response  object  of
       <b>monitor_cond_since</b>.

       All  other  parameters  are the same as in <b>update2</b> monitor notification
       (see Section 4.1.14).

   <b>4.1.17</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Server</b> <b>ID</b>
       A new RPC method added in Open vSwitch version 2.7.  The  request  con‐
       tains the following members:

          "method": "get_server_id"
          "params": null
          "id": &lt;nonnull-json-value&gt;

       The response object contains the following members:

          "result": "&lt;server_id&gt;"
          "error": null
          "id": same "id" as request

       &lt;server_id&gt;  is  JSON string that contains a UUID that uniquely identi‐
       fies the running OVSDB server process.  A fresh UUID is generated  when
       the process restarts.

   <b>4.1.18</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Awareness</b>
       RFC  7047  does  not  provide a way for a client to find out about some
       kinds of configuration changes, such as about databases  added  or  re‐
       moved  while a client is connected to the server, or databases changing
       between read/write and read-only due to a transition between active and
       backup roles.   Traditionally,  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  disconnects  all  of  its
       clients  when  this happens, because this prompts a well-written client
       to reassess what is available from the server when it reconnects.

       OVS 2.9 provides a way for clients to keep  track  of  these  kinds  of
       changes,  by  monitoring the <b>Database</b> table in the <b>_Server</b> database in‐
       troduced in this release (see <b>ovsdb-server(5)</b> for details).  By itself,
       this does not suppress <b>ovsdb-server</b> disconnection behavior,  because  a
       client  might  monitor  this database without understanding its special
       semantics.  Instead, <b>ovsdb-server</b> provides a special request:

          "method": "set_db_change_aware"
          "params": [&lt;boolean&gt;]
          "id": &lt;nonnull-json-value&gt;

       If the boolean in the  request  is  true,  it  suppresses  the  connec‐
       tion-closing  behavior  for  the current connection, and false restores
       the default behavior.  The reply is always the same:

          "result": {}
          "error": null
          "id": same "id" as request

   <b>4.1.19</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       Open vSwitch 2.9 adds a new JSON-RPC request to convert an online data‐
       base from one schema to another.  The request  contains  the  following
       members:

          "method": "convert"
          "params": [&lt;db-name&gt;, &lt;database-schema&gt;]
          "id": &lt;nonnull-json-value&gt;

       Upon  receipt,  the server converts database &lt;db-name&gt; to schema &lt;data‐
       base-schema&gt;.  The schema’s name must be &lt;db-name&gt;.  The conversion  is
       atomic,  consistent,  isolated,  and durable.  The data in the database
       must be valid when interpreted under &lt;database-schema&gt;, with  only  one
       exception:  data  for  tables  and columns that do not exist in the new
       schema are ignored.  Columns that exist in &lt;database-schema&gt; but not in
       the database are set to their default values.  All of the new  schema’s
       constraints apply in full.

       If  the  conversion is successful, the server notifies clients that use
       the <b>set_db_change_aware</b> RPC introduced in Open vSwitch 2.9 and  cancels
       their  outstanding  transactions  and monitors.  The server disconnects
       other clients, enabling them to notice the change when they  reconnect.
       The server sends the following reply:

          "result": {}
          "error": null
          "id": same "id" as request

       If  the  conversion  fails, then the server sends an error reply in the
       following form:

          "result": null
          "error": [&lt;error&gt;]
          "id": same "id" as request

   <b>5.1</b> <b>Notation</b>
       For &lt;condition&gt;, RFC 7047 only allows the use of <b>!=</b>, <b>==</b>, <b>includes</b>,  and
       <b>excludes</b>  operators  with set types.  Open vSwitch 2.4 and later extend
       &lt;condition&gt; to allow the use of <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;=</b>, and <b>&gt;</b> operators with a  col‐
       umn with type “set of 0 or 1 integer” and an integer argument, and with
       “set of 0 or 1 real” and a real argument.  These conditions evaluate to
       false  when the column is empty, and otherwise as described in RFC 7047
       for integer and real types.

       &lt;condition&gt; is specified in Section 5.1 in the RFC with  the  following
       change:  A  condition can be either a 3-element JSON array as described
       in the RFC or a boolean value. In case of an empty  array  an  implicit
       true boolean value will be considered.

   <b>5.2.1</b> <b>Insert</b>
       As  an  extension,  Open  vSwitch 2.13 and later allow an optional <b>uuid</b>
       member to specify the UUID for the new row.  The specified UUID must be
       unique within the table when it is inserted and not the UUID of  a  row
       previously  deleted within the transaction.  If the UUID violates these
       rules, then the operation fails with a <b>duplicate</b> <b>uuid</b> error.

   <b>5.2.6</b> <b>Wait,</b> <b>5.2.7</b> <b>Commit,</b> <b>5.2.9</b> <b>Comment</b>
       RFC 7047 says that the <b>wait</b>, <b>commit</b>, and  <b>comment</b>  operations  have  no
       corresponding  result object.  This is not true.  Instead, when such an
       operation is successful, it yields a result object with no members.
