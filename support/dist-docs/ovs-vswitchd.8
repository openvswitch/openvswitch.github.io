.SH NAME
ovs\-vswitchd \- Open vSwitch daemon
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBovs\-vswitchd \fR[\fIdatabase\fR]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A daemon that manages and controls any number of Open vSwitch switches
on the local machine.
.PP
The \fIdatabase\fR argument specifies how \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR connects
to \fBovsdb\-server\fR.  The default is \fBunix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock\fR.
The following forms are accepted:
.IP "\fBssl:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fR"
The specified SSL \fIport\fR on the host at the given \fIip\fR, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4 or IPv6 address
format.  If \fIip\fR is an IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square
brackets, e.g.: \fBssl:[::1]:6632\fR.
The \fB\-\-private\-key\fR, \fB\-\-certificate\fR, and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR
options are mandatory when this form is used.
.
.IP "\fBtcp:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fR"
Connect to the given TCP \fIport\fR on \fIip\fR, where \fIip\fR can be IPv4
or IPv6 address. If \fIip\fR is an IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with
square brackets, e.g.: \fBtcp:[::1]:6632\fR.
.
.IP "\fBunix:\fIfile\fR"
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named \fIfile\fR.
.IP
On Windows, connect to a localhost TCP port whose value is written in
\fIfile\fR.
.IP "\fBpssl:\fIport\fR[\fB:\fIip\fR]"
Listen on the given SSL \fIport\fR for a connection.  By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address and
it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) addresses, but
specifying \fIip\fR limits connections to those from the given
\fIip\fR, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If \fIip\fR is
an IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e.g.:
\fBpssl:6632:[::1]\fR.  The \fB\-\-private\-key\fR,
\fB\-\-certificate\fR, and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR options are mandatory
when this form is used.
.
.IP "\fBptcp:\fIport\fR[\fB:\fIip\fR]"
Listen on the given TCP \fIport\fR for a connection.  By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address and
it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) addresses, but
\fIip\fR may be specified to listen only for connections to the given
\fIip\fR, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If \fIip\fR is
an IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e.g.:
\fBptcp:6632:[::1]\fR.
.
.IP "\fBpunix:\fIfile\fR"
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named \fIfile\fR for a
connection.
.IP
On Windows, listen on a kernel chosen TCP port on the localhost. The kernel
chosen TCP port value is written in \fIfile\fR.
.PP
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR retrieves its configuration from \fIdatabase\fR at
startup.  It sets up Open vSwitch datapaths and then operates
switching across each bridge described in its configuration files.  As
the database changes, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR automatically updates its
configuration to match.
.PP
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR switches may be configured with any of the following
features:
.
.IP \(bu
L2 switching with MAC learning.
.
.IP \(bu
NIC bonding with automatic fail-over and source MAC-based TX load
balancing ("SLB").
.
.IP \(bu
802.1Q VLAN support.
.
.IP \(bu
Port mirroring, with optional VLAN tagging.
.
.IP \(bu
NetFlow v5 flow logging.
.
.IP \(bu
sFlow(R) monitoring.
.
.IP \(bu
Connectivity to an external OpenFlow controller, such as NOX.
.
.PP
Only a single instance of \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is intended to run at a time.
A single \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR can manage any number of switch instances, up
to the maximum number of supported Open vSwitch datapaths.
.PP
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR does all the necessary management of Open vSwitch datapaths
itself.  Thus, external tools, such \fBovs\-dpctl\fR(8), are not needed for
managing datapaths in conjunction with \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR, and their use
to modify datapaths when \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is running can interfere with
its operation.  (\fBovs\-dpctl\fR may still be useful for diagnostics.)
.PP
An Open vSwitch datapath kernel module must be loaded for \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
to be useful.  Please refer to the \fBINSTALL.Linux\fR file included in the
Open vSwitch distribution for instructions on how to build and load
the Open vSwitch kernel module.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-\-mlockall\fR"
Causes \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR to call the \fBmlockall()\fR function, to
attempt to lock all of its process memory into physical RAM,
preventing the kernel from paging any of its memory to disk.  This
helps to avoid networking interruptions due to system memory pressure.
.IP
Some systems do not support \fBmlockall()\fR at all, and other systems
only allow privileged users, such as the superuser, to use it.
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR emits a log message if \fBmlockall()\fR is
unavailable or unsuccessful.
.
.SS "DPDK Options"
.IP "\fB\-\-dpdk\fR"
Initialize \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR DPDK datapath.  Refer to INSTALL.DPDK
for details.
.SS "Daemon Options"
.ds DD \
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR detaches only after it has connected to the \
database, retrieved the initial configuration, and set up that \
configuration.
The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR[\fB=\fIpidfile\fR]
Causes a file (by default, \fB\*(PN.pid\fR) to be created indicating
the PID of the running process.  If the \fIpidfile\fR argument is not
specified, or
if it does not begin with \fB/\fR, then it is created in
\fB/var/run/openvswitch\fR.
.IP
If \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, no pidfile is created.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is specified and the specified pidfile 
already exists and is locked by a running process, \fB\*(PN\fR refuses 
to start.  Specify \fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR to cause it to instead 
overwrite the pidfile.
.IP
When \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, this option has no effect.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-detach\fR
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to detach itself from the foreground session and
run as a background process. \*(DD
.
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\fR
Creates an additional process to monitor the \fB\*(PN\fR daemon.  If
the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error
(\fBSIGABRT\fR, \fBSIGALRM\fR, \fBSIGBUS\fR, \fBSIGFPE\fR,
\fBSIGILL\fR, \fBSIGPIPE\fR, \fBSIGSEGV\fR, \fBSIGXCPU\fR, or
\fBSIGXFSZ\fR) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it.  If
the daemon dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process exits.
.IP
This option is normally used with \fB\-\-detach\fR, but it also
functions without it.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR 
changes its current working directory to the root directory after it 
detaches.  Otherwise, invoking \fB\*(PN\fR from a carelessly chosen 
directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting the file 
system that holds that directory.
.IP
Specifying \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR suppresses this behavior, preventing
\fB\*(PN\fR from changing its current working directory.  This may be 
useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to write 
core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory 
is not a good directory to use.
.IP
This option has no effect when \fB\-\-detach\fR is not specified.
.SS "Service Options"
The following options are valid only on Windows platform.
.TP
\fB\-\-service\fR
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to run as a service in the background. The service
should already have been created through external tools like \fBSC.exe\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-service\-monitor\fR
Causes the \fB\*(PN\fR service to be automatically restarted by the Windows
services manager if the service dies or exits for unexpected reasons.
.IP
When \fB\-\-service\fR is not specified, this option has no effect.
.SS "Public Key Infrastructure Options"
.de IQ
.  br
.  ns
.  IP "\\$1"
..
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIprivkey.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-private\-key=\fIprivkey.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as \fB\*(PN\fR's
identity for outgoing SSL connections.
.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIcert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-certificate=\fIcert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
private key specified on \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-private\-key\fR to be
trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the certificate
authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.
.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIcacert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that \fB\*(PN\fR
should use to verify certificates presented to it by SSL peers.  (This
may be the same certificate that SSL peers use to verify the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may
be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
.
.IP "\fB\-C none\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=none\fR"
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL peers.  This
introduces a security risk, because it means that certificates cannot
be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
When \fIcacert.pem\fR exists, this option has the same effect as
\fB\-C\fR or \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.  If it does not exist, then
\fB\*(PN\fR will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the
SSL peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM
file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection
and reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be
authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus
obtained.
.IP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.IP
This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as
part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol does not require
the server to send the CA certificate.
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-C\fR and
\fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.
.SS "Logging Options"

.  br
.  ns
.  IP "\\$1"
..
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and facility to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIfacility\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
.SS "Other Options"
.IP "\fB\-\-unixctl=\fIsocket\fR"
Sets the name of the control socket on which \fB\*(PN\fR listens for
runtime management commands (see \fBRUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\fR,
below).  If \fIsocket\fR does not begin with \fB/\fR, it is
interpreted as relative to \fB/var/run/openvswitch\fR.  If \fB\-\-unixctl\fR is
not used at all, the default socket is
\fB/var/run/openvswitch/\*(PN.\fIpid\fB.ctl\fR, where \fIpid\fR is \fB\*(PN\fR's
process ID.
.IP
On Windows, uses a kernel chosen TCP port on the localhost to listen
for runtime management commands.  The kernel chosen TCP port value is written
in a file whose absolute path is pointed by \fIsocket\fR. If \fB\-\-unixctl\fR
is not used at all, the file is created as \fB\*(PN.ctl\fR in the configured
\fIOVS_RUNDIR\fR directory.
.IP
Specifying \fBnone\fR for \fIsocket\fR disables the control socket
feature.

.SH "RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS"
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) can send commands to a running
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR process.  The currently supported commands are
described below.  The command descriptions assume an understanding of
how to configure Open vSwitch.
.SS "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBexit\fR"
Causes \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR to gracefully terminate.
.IP "\fBqos/show\fR \fIinterface\fR"
Queries the kernel for Quality of Service configuration and statistics
associated with the given \fIinterface\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd/show\fR [\fIinterface\fR]"
Displays detailed information about Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
configured on \fIinterface\fR.  If \fIinterface\fR is not specified,
then displays detailed information about all interfaces with BFD
enabled.
.IP "\fBbfd/set-forwarding\fR [\fIinterface\fR] \fIstatus\fR"
Force the fault status of the BFD module on \fIinterface\fR (or all
interfaces if none is given) to be \fIstatus\fR.  \fIstatus\fR can be
"true", "false", or "normal" which reverts to the standard behavior.
.IP "\fBcfm/show\fR [\fIinterface\fR]"
Displays detailed information about Connectivity Fault Management
configured on \fIinterface\fR.  If \fIinterface\fR is not specified,
then displays detailed information about all interfaces with CFM
enabled.
.IP "\fBcfm/set-fault\fR [\fIinterface\fR] \fIstatus\fR"
Force the fault status of the CFM module on \fIinterface\fR (or all
interfaces if none is given) to be \fIstatus\fR.  \fIstatus\fR can be
"true", "false", or "normal" which reverts to the standard behavior.
.IP "\fBstp/tcn\fR [\fIbridge\fR]"
Forces a topology change event on \fIbridge\fR if it's running STP.  This
may cause it to send Topology Change Notifications to its peers and flush
its MAC table..  If no \fIbridge\fR is given, forces a topology change
event on all bridges.
.SS "BRIDGE COMMANDS"
These commands manage bridges.
.IP "\fBfdb/flush\fR [\fIbridge\fR]"
Flushes \fIbridge\fR MAC address learning table, or all learning tables
if no \fIbridge\fR is given.
.IP "\fBfdb/show\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Lists each MAC address/VLAN pair learned by the specified \fIbridge\fR,
along with the port on which it was learned and the age of the entry,
in seconds.
.IP "\fBmdb/flush\fR [\fIbridge\fR]"
Flushes \fIbridge\fR multicast snooping table, or all snooping tables
if no \fIbridge\fR is given.
.IP "\fBmdb/show\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Lists each multicast group/VLAN pair learned by the specified \fIbridge\fR,
along with the port on which it was learned and the age of the entry,
in seconds.
.IP "\fBbridge/reconnect\fR [\fIbridge\fR]"
Makes \fIbridge\fR drop all of its OpenFlow controller connections and
reconnect.  If \fIbridge\fR is not specified, then all bridges drop
their controller connections and reconnect.
.IP
This command might be useful for debugging OpenFlow controller issues.
.
.IP "\fBbridge/dump\-flows\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all flows in \fIbridge\fR, including those normally hidden to
commands such as \fBovs\-ofctl dump\-flows\fR.  Flows set up by mechanisms
such as in-band control and fail-open are hidden from the controller
since it is not allowed to modify or override them.
.SS "BOND COMMANDS"
These commands manage bonded ports on an Open vSwitch's bridges.  To
understand some of these commands, it is important to understand a
detail of the bonding implementation called ``source load balancing''
(SLB).  Instead of directly assigning Ethernet source addresses to
slaves, the bonding implementation computes a function that maps an
48-bit Ethernet source addresses into an 8-bit value (a ``MAC hash''
value).  All of the Ethernet addresses that map to a single 8-bit
value are then assigned to a single slave.
.IP "\fBbond/list\fR"
Lists all of the bonds, and their slaves, on each bridge.
.
.IP "\fBbond/show\fR [\fIport\fR]"
Lists all of the bond-specific information (updelay, downdelay, time
until the next rebalance) about the given bonded \fIport\fR, or all
bonded ports if no \fIport\fR is given.  Also lists information about
each slave: whether it is enabled or disabled, the time to completion
of an updelay or downdelay if one is in progress, whether it is the
active slave, the hashes assigned to the slave.  Any LACP information
related to this bond may be found using the \fBlacp/show\fR command.
.
.IP "\fBbond/migrate\fR \fIport\fR \fIhash\fR \fIslave\fR"
Only valid for SLB bonds.  Assigns a given MAC hash to a new slave.
\fIport\fR specifies the bond port, \fIhash\fR the MAC hash to be
migrated (as a decimal number between 0 and 255), and \fIslave\fR the
new slave to be assigned.
.IP
The reassignment is not permanent: rebalancing or fail-over will
cause the MAC hash to be shifted to a new slave in the usual
manner.
.IP
A MAC hash cannot be migrated to a disabled slave.
.IP "\fBbond/set\-active\-slave\fR \fIport\fR \fIslave\fR"
Sets \fIslave\fR as the active slave on \fIport\fR.  \fIslave\fR must
currently be enabled.
.IP
The setting is not permanent: a new active slave will be selected
if \fIslave\fR becomes disabled.
.IP "\fBbond/enable\-slave\fR \fIport\fR \fIslave\fR"
.IQ "\fBbond/disable\-slave\fR \fIport\fR \fIslave\fR"
Enables (or disables) \fIslave\fR on the given bond \fIport\fR, skipping any
updelay (or downdelay).
.IP
This setting is not permanent: it persists only until the carrier
status of \fIslave\fR changes.
.IP "\fBbond/hash\fR \fImac\fR [\fIvlan\fR] [\fIbasis\fR]"
Returns the hash value which would be used for \fImac\fR with \fIvlan\fR
and \fIbasis\fR if specified.
.
.IP "\fBlacp/show\fR [\fIport\fR]"
Lists all of the LACP related information about the given \fIport\fR:
active or passive, aggregation key, system id, and system priority.  Also
lists information about each slave: whether it is enabled or disabled,
whether it is attached or detached, port id and priority, actor
information, and partner information.  If \fIport\fR is not specified,
then displays detailed information about all interfaces with CFM
enabled.
.SS "DPCTL DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS"
The primary way to configure \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is through the Open
vSwitch database, e.g. using \fBovs\-vsctl\fR(8).  These commands
provide a debugging interface for managing datapaths.  They implement
the same features (and syntax) as \fBovs\-dpctl\fR(8).  Unlike
\fBovs\-dpctl\fR(8), these commands work with datapaths that are
integrated into \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR (e.g. the \fBnetdev\fR datapath
type).
.PP
.
.ds DX \fBdpctl/\fR
.de DO
\\$2 \\$1 \\$3
..
.TP
\*(DX\fBadd\-dp \fIdp\fR [\fInetdev\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]...]
Creates datapath \fIdp\fR, with a local port also named \fIdp\fR.
This will fail if a network device \fIdp\fR already exists.
.IP
If \fInetdev\fRs are specified, \fB\*(PN\fR adds them to the
new datapath, just as if \fBadd\-if\fR was specified.
.
.TP
\*(DX\fBdel\-dp \fIdp\fR
Deletes datapath \fIdp\fR.  If \fIdp\fR is associated with any network
devices, they are automatically removed.
.
.TP
\*(DX\fBadd\-if \fIdp netdev\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]...
Adds each \fInetdev\fR to the set of network devices datapath
\fIdp\fR monitors, where \fIdp\fR is the name of an existing
datapath, and \fInetdev\fR is the name of one of the host's
network devices, e.g. \fBeth0\fR.  Once a network device has been added
to a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the network device's
traffic and the network device appears silent to the rest of the
system.
.IP
A \fInetdev\fR may be followed by a comma-separated list of options.
The following options are currently supported:
.
.RS
.IP "\fBtype=\fItype\fR"
Specifies the type of port to add.  The default type is \fBsystem\fR.
.IP "\fBport_no=\fIport\fR"
Requests a specific port number within the datapath.  If this option is
not specified then one will be automatically assigned.
.IP "\fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR"
Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's configuration.
.RE
.IP
\fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) documents the available port types and
options.
.
.IP "\*(DX\fBset\-if \fIdp port\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]..."
Reconfigures each \fIport\fR in \fIdp\fR as specified.  An
\fIoption\fR of the form \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR adds the specified
key-value option to the port or overrides an existing key's value.  An
\fIoption\fR of the form \fIkey\fB=\fR, that is, without a value,
deletes the key-value named \fIkey\fR.  The type and port number of a
port cannot be changed, so \fBtype\fR and \fBport_no\fR are only allowed if
they match the existing configuration.
.TP
\*(DX\fBdel\-if \fIdp netdev\fR...
Removes each \fInetdev\fR from the list of network devices datapath
\fIdp\fR monitors.
.
.TP
\*(DX\fBdump\-dps\fR
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.
.
.TP
.DO "[\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-statistics\fR]" "\*(DX\fBshow" "\fR[\fIdp\fR...]"
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their datapath
numbers and a list of ports connected to each datapath.  (The local
port is identified as port 0.)  If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR
is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for each
port.
.IP
The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow mask stats.
.IP
The "lookups" row displays three stats related to flow lookup triggered
by processing incoming packets in the datapath. "hit" displays number
of packets matches existing flows. "missed" displays the number of
packets not matching any existing flow and require user space processing.
"lost" displays number of packets destined for user space process but
subsequently dropped before reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss"
equals to the total number of packets datapath processed.
.IP
The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.
.IP
The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is omitted
for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit" displays the total number
of masks visited for matching incoming packets. "total" displays number of
masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" displays the average number of masks
visited per packet; the ratio between "hit" and total number of
packets processed by the datapath".
.IP
If one or more datapaths are specified, information on only those
datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, \fB\*(PN\fR displays information
about all configured datapaths.
.SS "DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING COMMANDS"
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open
vSwitch.  The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that they
work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different
and considerably simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel
module.  Use \fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8), instead, to work with OpenFlow flow
entries.
.
.PP
The \fIdp\fR argument to each of these commands is optional when
exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
required.

Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath \fIdp\fR's flow
table.  Without \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-\-more\fR, output omits match fields
that a flow wildcards entirely; with \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-\-more\fR,
output includes all wildcarded fields.
.IP
If \fBfilter=\fIfilter\fR is specified, only displays the flows
that match the \fIfilter\fR. \fIfilter\fR is a flow in the form similiar
to that accepted by \fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8)'s \fBadd\-flow\fR command. (This is
not an OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it never contains wildcards.)
The \fIfilter\fR is also useful to match wildcarded fields in the datapath
flow. As an example, \fBfilter='tcp,tp_src=100'\fR will match the
datapath flow containing '\fBtcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)\fR'.

Adds or modifies a flow in \fIdp\fR's flow table that, when a packet
matching \fIflow\fR arrives, causes \fIactions\fR to be executed.
.IP
The \fBadd\-flow\fR command succeeds only if \fIflow\fR does not
already exist in \fIdp\fR.  Contrariwise, \fBmod\-flow\fR without
\fB\-\-may\-create\fR only modifies the actions for an existing flow.
With \fB\-\-may\-create\fR, \fBmod\-flow\fR will add a new flow or
modify an existing one.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR is specified, then
\fBmod\-flows\fR prints the modified flow's statistics.  A flow's
statistics are the number of packets and bytes that have passed
through the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags
processed through the flow.
.IP
With \fB\-\-clear\fR, \fBmod\-flows\fR zeros out the flow's
statistics.  The statistics printed if \fB\-s\fR or
\fB\-\-statistics\fR is also specified are those from just before
clearing the statistics.
.
.TP
.DO "[\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-statistics\fR]" "\*(DX\fBdel\-flow\fR" "[\fIdp\fR] \fIflow\fR"
Deletes the flow from \fIdp\fR's flow table that matches \fIflow\fR.
If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR is specified, then
\fBmod\-flows\fR prints the deleted flow's statistics.

.SS "DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS"
These commands query and modify datapaths.  They are are similar to
\fBovs\-dpctl\fR(8) commands.  \fBdpif/show\fR has the additional
functionality, beyond \fBdpctl/show\fR of printing OpenFlow port
numbers.  The other commands are redundant and will be removed in a
future release.
.
.IP "\fBdpif/dump\-dps\fR"
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.
.
.IP "\fBdpif/show\fR"
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including statistics and a
list of connected ports.  The port information includes the OpenFlow
port number, datapath port number, and the type.  (The local port is
identified as OpenFlow port 65534.)
.
.IP "\fBdpif/dump\-flows\fR [\fB\-m\fR] \fIdp\fR"
Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath \fIdp\fR's
flow table. Without \fB\-m\fR, output omits match fields that a flow
wildcards entirely; with \fB\-m\fR output includes all wildcarded fields.
.IP
This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  The flow
table entries that it displays are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead,
they are different and considerably simpler flows maintained by the
datapath module.  If you wish to see the OpenFlow flow entries, use
\fBovs\-ofctl dump\-flows\fR.
.
.IP "\fBdpif/del\-flows \fIdp\fR"
Deletes all flow entries from datapath \fIdp\fR's flow table and
underlying datapath implementation (e.g., kernel datapath module).
.IP
This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  As
discussed in \fBdpif/dump\-flows\fR, these entries are
not OpenFlow flow entries.
.SS "OFPROTO COMMANDS"

Traces the path of an imaginary packet through \fIswitch\fR and
reports the path that it took.  The initial treatment of the packet
varies based on the command:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBofproto/trace\fR looks the packet up in the OpenFlow flow table, as
if the packet had arrived on an OpenFlow port.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBofproto/trace\-packet\-out\fR applies the specified OpenFlow
\fIactions\fR, as if the packet, flow, and actions had been specified
in an OpenFlow ``packet-out'' request.
.RE
.
.IP
The packet's headers (e.g. source and destination) and metadata
(e.g. input port), together called its ``flow,'' are usually all that
matter for the purpose of tracing a packet.  You can specify the flow
in the following ways:
.
.RS
.IP "\fIdpname\fR \fIodp_flow\fR"
\fIodp_flow\fR is a flow in the form printed by \fBovs\-dpctl\fR(8)'s
\fBdump\-flows\fR command.  If all of your bridges have the same type,
which is the common case, then you can omit \fIdpname\fR, but if you
have bridges of different types (say, both \fBovs-netdev\fR and
\fBovs-system\fR), then you need to specify a \fIdpname\fR to disambiguate.
.
.IP "\fIbridge\fR \fIbr_flow\fR"
\fIbr_flow\fR is a flow in the form similar to that accepted by
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8)'s \fBadd\-flow\fR command.  (This is not an
OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it never contains
wildcards.)  \fIbridge\fR names of the bridge through which
\fIbr_flow\fR should be traced.
.RE
.
.IP
Most commonly, one specifies only a flow, using one of the forms
above, but sometimes one might need to specify an actual packet
instead of just a flow:
.
.RS
.IP "Side effects."
Some actions have side effects.  For example, the \fBnormal\fR action
can update the MAC learning table, and the \fBlearn\fR action can
change OpenFlow tables.  The trace commands only perform side
effects when a packet is specified.  If you want side effects to take
place, then you must supply a packet.
.
.IP
(Output actions are obviously side effects too, but
the trace commands never execute them, even when one specifies a
packet.)
.
.IP "Incomplete information."
Most of the time, Open vSwitch can figure out everything about the
path of a packet using just the flow, but in some special
circumstances it needs to look at parts of the packet that are not
included in the flow.  When this is the case, and you do not supply a
packet, then a trace command will tell you it needs a packet.
.RE
.
.IP
If you wish to include a packet as part of a trace operation, there
are two ways to do it:
.
.RS
.IP \fB\-generate\fR
This option, added to one of the ways to specify a flow already
described, causes Open vSwitch to internally generate a packet with
the flow described and then to use that packet.  If your goal is to
execute side effects, then \fB\-generate\fR is the easiest way to do
it, but \fB\-generate\fR is not a good way to fill in incomplete
information, because it generates packets based on only the flow
information, which means that the packets really do not have any more
information than the flow.
.
.IP \fIpacket\fR
This form supplies an explicit \fIpacket\fR as a sequence of hex
digits.  An Ethernet frame is at least 14 bytes long, so there must be
at least 28 hex digits.  Obviously, it is inconvenient to type in the
hex digits by hand, so the \fBovs\-pcap\fR(1) and
\fBovs\-tcpundump\fR(1) utilities provide easier ways.
.IP
With this form, packet headers are extracted directly from
\fIpacket\fR, so the \fIodp_flow\fR or \fIbr_flow\fR should specify
only metadata. The metadata can be:
.RS
.IP \fIskb_priority\fR
Packet QoS priority.
.IP \fIpkt_mark\fR
Mark of the packet.
.IP \fItun_id\fR
The tunnel ID on which the packet arrived.
.IP \fIin_port\fR
The port on which the packet arrived.
.RE
.RE
.
.IP
The in_port value is kernel datapath port number for the first format
and OpenFlow port number for the second format. The numbering of these
two types of port usually differs and there is no relationship.
.
.IP
\fBofproto\-trace\-packet\-out\fR accepts an additional
\fB\-consistent\fR option.  With this option specified, the command
rejects \fIactions\fR that are inconsistent with the specified packet.
(An example of an inconsistency is attempting to strip the VLAN tag
from a packet that does not have a VLAN tag.)  Open vSwitch ignores
most forms of inconsistency in OpenFlow 1.0 and rejects
inconsistencies in later versions of OpenFlow.  The option is
necessary because the command does not ordinarily imply a particular
OpenFlow version.  One exception is that, when \fIactions\fR includes
an action that only OpenFlow 1.1 and later supports (such as
\fBpush_vlan\fR), \fB\-consistent\fR is automatically enabled.
.IP "\fBofproto/self\-check\fR [\fIswitch\fR]"
Runs an internal consistency check on \fIswitch\fR, if specified,
otherwise on all ofproto instances, and responds with a brief summary
of the results.  If the summary reports any errors, then the Open
vSwitch logs should contain more detailed information.  Please pass
along errors reported by this command to the Open vSwitch developers
as bugs.

.SS "VLOG COMMANDS"
These commands manage \fB\*(PN\fR's logging settings.
.IP "\fBvlog/set\fR [\fIspec\fR]"
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and facility to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu 
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\*(PN\fR was invoked with the
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR option.
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.RE
.IP "\fBvlog/set PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIfacility\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/list\fR"
Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/reopen\fR"
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to close and reopen its log file.  (This is useful
after rotating log files, to cause a new log file to be used.)
.IP
This has no effect unless \fB\*(PN\fR was invoked with the
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR option.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/disable\-rate\-limit \fR[\fImodule\fR]..."
.IQ "\fBvlog/enable\-rate\-limit \fR[\fImodule\fR]..."
By default, \fB\*(PN\fR limits the rate at which certain messages can
be logged.  When a message would appear more frequently than the
limit, it is suppressed.  This saves disk space, makes logs easier to
read, and speeds up execution, but occasionally troubleshooting
requires more detail.  Therefore, \fBvlog/disable\-rate\-limit\fR
allows rate limits to be disabled at the level of an individual log
module.  Specify one or more module names, as displayed by the
\fBvlog/list\fR command.  Specifying either no module names at all or
the keyword \fBany\fR disables rate limits for every log module.
.
.IP
The \fBvlog/enable\-rate\-limit\fR command, whose syntax is the same
as \fBvlog/disable\-rate\-limit\fR, can be used to re-enable a rate
limit that was previously disabled.
.SS "MEMORY COMMANDS"
These commands report memory usage.
.
.IP "\fBmemory/show\fR"
Displays some basic statistics about \fB\*(PN\fR's memory usage.
\fB\*(PN\fR also logs this information soon after startup and
periodically as its memory consumption grows.
.SS "COVERAGE COMMANDS"
These commands manage \fB\*(PN\fR's ``coverage counters,'' which count
the number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
In addition to these commands, \fB\*(PN\fR automatically logs coverage
counter values, at \fBINFO\fR level, when it detects that the daemon's
main loop takes unusually long to run.
.PP
Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and
debugging.
.IP "\fBcoverage/show\fR"
Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds, the
last minute and the last hour, and the total counts of all of the
coverage counters.

.IP "\fBovs/route/add ipv4_address/plen output_bridge [GW]\fR"
Adds ipv4_address/plen route to vswitchd routing table. output_bridge
needs to be OVS bridge name.  This command is useful if OVS cached
routes does not look right.

.IP "\fBovs/route/show\fR"
Print all routes in OVS routing table, This includes routes cached
from system routing table and user configured routes.
.
.IP "\fBovs/route/del ipv4_address/plen\fR"

Flush ARP table.
.
.IP "\fBtnl/egress_port_range [num1] [num2]\fR"
Set range for UDP source port used for UDP based Tunnels. For
example VxLAN. If case of zero arguments this command prints
current range in use.

.SH "OPENFLOW IMPLEMENTATION"
.
.PP
This section documents aspects of OpenFlow for which the OpenFlow
specification requires documentation.
.
.SS "Packet buffering."
The OpenFlow specification, version 1.2, says:
.
.IP
Switches that implement buffering are expected to expose, through
documentation, both the amount of available buffering, and the length
of time before buffers may be reused.
.
.PP
Open vSwitch maintains a separate set of 256 packet buffers for each
OpenFlow connection.  Any given packet buffer is preserved until it is
referenced by an \fBOFPT_FLOW_MOD\fR or \fBOFPT_PACKET_OUT\fR request
or for 5 seconds, whichever comes first.
.
.SH "LIMITS"
.
.PP
We believe these limits to be accurate as of this writing.  These
limits assume the use of the Linux kernel datapath.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR started through \fBovs\-ctl\fR(8) provides a limit of 7500
file descriptors.  The limits on the number of bridges and ports is decided by
the availability of file descriptors.  With the Linux kernel datapath, creation
of a single bridge consumes 3 file descriptors and adding a port consumes
1 file descriptor.  Performance will degrade beyond 1,024 ports per bridge due
to fixed hash table sizing.  Other platforms may have different limitations.
.
.IP \(bu
2,048 MAC learning entries per bridge, by default.  (This is
configurable via \fBother\-config:mac\-table\-size\fR in the
\fBBridge\fR table.  See \fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for details.)
.
.IP \(bu
Kernel flows are limited only by memory available to the kernel.
Performance will degrade beyond 1,048,576 kernel flows per bridge with
a 32-bit kernel, beyond 262,144 with a 64-bit kernel.
(\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR should never install anywhere near that many
flows.)
.
.IP \(bu
OpenFlow flows are limited only by available memory.  Performance is
linear in the number of unique wildcard patterns.  That is, an
OpenFlow table that contains many flows that all match on the same
fields in the same way has a constant-time lookup, but a table that
contains many flows that match on different fields requires lookup
time linear in the number of flows.
.
.IP \(bu
255 ports per bridge participating in 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol.
