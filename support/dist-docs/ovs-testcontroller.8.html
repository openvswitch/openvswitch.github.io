<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-testcontroller - simple OpenFlow controller for testing

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>method</u> <b>[</b><u>method</u>]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  is  a  simple  OpenFlow controller that manages any
       number of switches over the OpenFlow protocol, causing them to function
       as L2 MAC-learning switches or hubs.  It is suitable for initial  test‐
       ing of OpenFlow networks.  It is not a necessary or desirable part of a
       production OpenFlow deployment.

       <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> controls one or more OpenFlow switches, specified as
       one or more of the following OpenFlow connection methods:

              <b>pssl:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
              <b>ptcp:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections on <u>port</u>.  The default
                     <u>port</u> is 6653.  By default, connections are  allowed  from
                     any  IPv4  address.  Specify <u>host</u> as an IPv4 address or a
                     bracketed IPv6 address (e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>).  On Linux,
                     use <b>%</b><u>device</u> to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level  ad‐
                     dresses, e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]</b>.  DNS names can
                     be  used  if  built  with unbound library.  For <b>pssl</b>, the
                     <b>--private-key</b>,<b>--certificate</b>, and  <b>--ca-cert</b>  options  are
                     mandatory.

              <b>punix:</b><u>file</u>
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections  on  the  Unix domain
                     server socket named <u>file</u>.

              <b>ssl:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
              <b>tcp:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The specified <u>port</u> on the given <u>host</u>, which  can  be  ex‐
                     pressed  either  as a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary) or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6  address  format.
                     Wrap    IPv6   addresses   in   square   brackets,   e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.  On Linux, use  <b>%</b><u>device</u>  to  designate  a
                     scope     for    IPv6    link-level    addresses,    e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653</b>.  For <b>ssl</b>, the  <b>--private-key</b>,
                     <b>--certificate</b>, and <b>--ca-cert</b> options are mandatory.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named <u>file</u>.

                     On  Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is repre‐
                     sented by a file created in the path <u>file</u>  to  mimic  the
                     behavior of a Unix domain socket.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--noflow</b>
              By  default,  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> sets up a flow in each OpenFlow
              switch whenever it receives a packet whose destination is  known
              due  through  MAC learning.  This option disables flow setup, so
              that every packet in the network passes through the controller.

              This option is most useful for debugging.  It reduces  switching
              performance, so it should not be used in production.

       <b>--max-idle=</b><u>secs</u>|<b>permanent</b>
              Sets  <u>secs</u>  as  the  number of seconds that a flow set up by the
              controller will remain in the switch's flow  table  without  any
              matching  packets  being seen.  If <b>permanent</b> is specified, which
              is not recommended, flows will never expire.  The default is  60
              seconds.

              This  option  has no effect when <b>-n</b> (or <b>--noflow</b>) is in use (be‐
              cause the controller does not set up flows in that case).

       <b>-H</b>
       <b>--hub</b>  By default, the controller acts as an  L2  MAC-learning  switch.
              This  option  changes  its behavior to that of a hub that floods
              packets on all but the incoming port.

              If <b>-H</b> (or <b>--hub</b>) and <b>-n</b> (or <b>--noflow</b>) are  used  together,  then
              the  cumulative  effect  is that every packet passes through the
              controller and every packet is flooded.

              This option is most useful for debugging.  It reduces  switching
              performance, so it should not be used in production.

       <b>-w</b>[<u>wildcard</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u>]
       <b>--wildcards</b>[<b>=</b><u>wildcard</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u>]
              By  default, <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> sets up exact-match flows.  This
              option allows it to set up wildcarded flows,  which  may  reduce
              flow  setup latency by causing less traffic to be sent up to the
              controller.

              The optional <u>wildcard</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u> is an OpenFlow  wildcard  bitmask  in
              hexadecimal  that specifies the fields to wildcard.  If no <u>wild‐</u>
              <u>card</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u> is specified, the default value 0x2820F0 is used which
              specifies L2-only switching and wildcards L3 and L4 fields.  An‐
              other interesting value is  0x2000EC,  which  specifies  L3-only
              switching and wildcards L2 and L4 fields.

              This  option  has no effect when <b>-n</b> (or <b>--noflow</b>) is in use (be‐
              cause the controller does not set up flows in that case).

       <b>-N</b>
       <b>--normal</b>
              By default, <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> directs packets to  a  particular
              port  or  floods  them.   This  option  causes it to direct non-
              flooded packets to the OpenFlow <b>OFPP_NORMAL</b> port.   This  allows
              the  switch  itself to make decisions about packet destinations.
              Support for <b>OFPP_NORMAL</b> is optional in OpenFlow, so this  option
              may not well with some non-Open vSwitch switches.

       <b>--mute</b> Prevents  ovs-testcontroller  from replying to any OpenFlow mes‐
              sages sent to it by switches.

              This option is only for debugging the Open  vSwitch  implementa‐
              tion of ``fail open'' mode.  It must not be used in production.

       <b>-q</b> <u>id</u>
       <b>--queue=</b><u>id</u>
              By  default,  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> uses the default OpenFlow queue
              for sending packets and setting up flows.  Use one of these  op‐
              tions, supplying <u>id</u> as an OpenFlow queue ID as a decimal number,
              to instead use that specific queue.

              This  option  is incompatible with <b>-N</b> or <b>--normal</b> and with <b>-H</b> or
              <b>--hub</b>.  If more than one is specified  then  this  option  takes
              precedence.

              This  option  may  be useful for testing or debugging quality of
              service setups.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>port-name</u><b>:</b><u>queue-id</u>

       <b>--port-queue</b> <u>port-name</u><b>:</b><u>queue-id</u>
              Configures packets received on the port  named  <u>port-name</u>  (e.g.
              <b>eth0</b>) to be output on OpenFlow queue ID <u>queue-id</u> (specified as a
              decimal  number).  For the specified port, this option overrides
              the default specified on <b>-q</b> or <b>--queue</b>.

              This option may be specified any number of times with  different
              <u>port-name</u> arguments.

              This  option  is incompatible with <b>-N</b> or <b>--normal</b> and with <b>-H</b> or
              <b>--hub</b>.  If more than one is specified  then  this  option  takes
              precedence.

              This  option  may  be useful for testing or debugging quality of
              service setups.

       <b>--with-flows</b> <u>file</u>
              When a switch connects, push the flow entries  as  described  in
              <u>file</u>.  Each line in <u>file</u> is a flow entry in the format described
              for  the  <b>add-flows</b>  command  in  the <b>Flow</b> <b>Syntax</b> section of the
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8) man page.

              Use this option more than once to add flows from multiple files.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented
              to it by SSL/TLS peers.  (This may be the same certificate  that
              SSL/TLS  peers  use to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or
              <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one,  depending  on  the
              PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it  means  that
              certificates  cannot  be  verified  to be those of known trusted
              hosts.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL/TLS peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should be
              the CA certificate used to sign  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s  own  cer‐
              tificate, that is, the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certifi‐</b>
              <b>cate</b>.   If <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s certificate is self-signed, then
              <b>--certificate</b> and <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This option is not  useful  in  normal  operation,  because  the
              SSL/TLS  peer  must already have the CA certificate for the peer
              to have any confidence in <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s  identity.   How‐
              ever,  this offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap the
              CA certificate on its first SSL/TLS connection.

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovs-testcontroller.pid</b>) to be created
              indicating the PID of the running process.  If the <u>pidfile</u> argu‐
              ment is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>,  then  it
              is created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By  default,  when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the specified pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  refuses  to start.  Specify <b>--overwrite-pid‐</b>
              <b>file</b> to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> as a background  process.   The  process
              forks,  and  in  the  child  it starts a new session, closes the
              standard file descriptors (which has the  side  effect  of  dis‐
              abling  logging  to the console), and changes its current direc‐
              tory to the root (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is  specified).   After  the
              child completes its initialization, the parent exits.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates  an additional process to monitor the <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>
              daemon.  If the daemon dies due to a  signal  that  indicates  a
              programming  error  (<b>SIGABRT</b>,  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  <b>SIGBUS</b>, <b>SIGFPE</b>, <b>SIGILL</b>,
              <b>SIGPIPE</b>, <b>SIGSEGV</b>, <b>SIGXCPU</b>, or <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor  process
              starts  a  new  copy of it.  If the daemon dies or exits for an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but  it  also  func‐
              tions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By  default,  when  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>
              changes its current working directory to the root directory  af‐
              ter  it detaches.  Otherwise, invoking <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> from a
              carelessly chosen directory would prevent the administrator from
              unmounting the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying  <b>--no-chdir</b>  suppresses  this  behavior,   preventing
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  from changing its current working directory.
              This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common
              behavior to write core dumps into the current working  directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By  default  daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with
              files under well-known directories determined during build.   It
              is  better  to  stick  with this default behavior and not to use
              this flag unless some other Access Control is  used  to  confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations  that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC
              or MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space  daemon
              itself  and hence should not be considered as a full confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user</b> Causes <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> to run as a different  user  specified
              in  "user:group",  thus  dropping  most  of the root privileges.
              Short forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed,  with  current
              user  or group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started by
              the root user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES  before  dropping root privileges. Daemons
              that interact with a datapath, such  as  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>,  will  be
              granted  three  additional  capabilities,  namely CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST and CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability  change  will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons,  specifying  this  option will cause the daemon process
              not to start.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the  <b>vlog/list</b>  com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>,  or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.   (If  <b>--detach</b>  is specified, <b>ovs-testcon‐</b>
                     <b>troller</b> closes its standard file descriptors, so  logging
                     to the console will have no effect.)

                     On  Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  <b>--syslog-target</b>  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>,  <b>emer</b>,  <b>err</b>,  <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  <b>off</b> filters out all  messages.   See  <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to <u>pattern</u>.  Refer to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message.  <u>facility</u>  can  be
              one  of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,  <b>local1</b>,  <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>,  <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not
              specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for  the  local  system
              syslog  and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <u>file</u> is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name  used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is   <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-testcontroller.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options  is  that libc adds fixed prefix to every message
                     before it is actually sent  to  the  syslog  daemon  over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However,  <b>rsyslogd</b>  <b>8.9</b> and older versions use hard coded
                     parser function anyway that  limits  UNIX  domain  socket
                     use.   If  you  want to use arbitrary message format with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible to use arbitrary message  format  also  with  older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.   When  sending syslog messages over UDP socket
                     extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for  ex‐
                     ample,  syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
                     the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could
                     be  interfering  with  local syslog traffic and there are
                     some security considerations that apply to  UDP  sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The  default  is  taken  from  the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>--unixctl=</b><u>socket</u>
              Sets the name of the control socket on which  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>
              listens  for runtime management commands (see <b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
              <b>COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <u>socket</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it is inter‐
              preted  as  relative  to   <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.    If
              <b>--unixctl</b>  is  not  used  at all, the default socket is <b>/usr/lo‐</b>
              <b>cal/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-testcontroller.</b><u>pid</u><b>.ctl</b>, where <u>pid</u> is
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement commands.  A file is created in  the  absolute  path  as
              pointed  by <u>socket</u> or if <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, a file is
              created as <b>ovs-testcontroller.ctl</b> in the  configured  <u>OVS</u><b>_</b><u>RUNDIR</u>
              directory.  The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix
              domain socket.

              Specifying <b>none</b> for <u>socket</u> disables the control socket feature.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

       <b>-O</b> [<u>version</u>[<b>,</b><u>version</u>]...]
       <b>--protocols=</b>[<u>version</u>[<b>,</b><u>version</u>]...]
              Sets the OpenFlow protocol versions that are allowed when estab‐
              lishing an OpenFlow session.

              These protocol versions are enabled by default:

              •      <b>OpenFlow10</b>, for OpenFlow 1.0.
       The  following  protocol versions are generally supported, but for com‐
       patibility with older versions of Open vSwitch they are not enabled  by
       default:

              •      <b>OpenFlow11</b>, for OpenFlow 1.1.

              •      <b>OpenFlow12</b>, for OpenFlow 1.2.

              •      <b>OpenFlow13</b>, for OpenFlow 1.3.

              •      <b>OpenFlow14</b>, for OpenFlow 1.4.

              •      <b>OpenFlow15</b>, for OpenFlow 1.5.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       To  bind  locally to port 6653 (the default) and wait for incoming con‐
       nections from OpenFlow switches:
