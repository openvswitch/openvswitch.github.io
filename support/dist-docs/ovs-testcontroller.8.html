<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-testcontroller - simple OpenFlow controller for testing

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>method</u> <b>[</b><u>method</u>]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  is  a  simple  OpenFlow controller that manages any
       number of switches over the OpenFlow protocol, causing them to function
       as L2 MAC-learning switches or hubs.  It is suitable for initial  test‐
       ing of OpenFlow networks.  It is not a necessary or desirable part of a
       production OpenFlow deployment.

       <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> controls one or more OpenFlow switches, specified as
       one or more of the following OpenFlow connection methods:

              <b>pssl:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
              <b>ptcp:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections on <u>port</u>.  The default
                     <u>port</u> is 6653.  By default, connections are  allowed  from
                     any  IPv4  address.  Specify <u>host</u> as an IPv4 address or a
                     bracketed IPv6 address (e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>).  On Linux,
                     use <b>%</b><u>device</u> to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level  ad‐
                     dresses, e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]</b>.  DNS names can
                     be  used  if  built  with unbound library.  For <b>pssl</b>, the
                     <b>--private-key</b>,<b>--certificate</b>, and  <b>--ca-cert</b>  options  are
                     mandatory.

              <b>punix:</b><u>file</u>
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections  on  the  Unix domain
                     server socket named <u>file</u>.

              <b>ssl:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
              <b>tcp:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The specified <u>port</u> on the given <u>host</u>, which  can  be  ex‐
                     pressed  either  as a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary) or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6  address  format.
                     Wrap    IPv6   addresses   in   square   brackets,   e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.  On Linux, use  <b>%</b><u>device</u>  to  designate  a
                     scope     for    IPv6    link-level    addresses,    e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653</b>.  For <b>ssl</b>, the  <b>--private-key</b>,
                     <b>--certificate</b>, and <b>--ca-cert</b> options are mandatory.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named <u>file</u>.

                     On  Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is repre‐
                     sented by a file created in the path <u>file</u>  to  mimic  the
                     behavior of a Unix domain socket.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--noflow</b>
              By  default,  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> sets up a flow in each OpenFlow
              switch whenever it receives a packet whose destination is  known
              due  through  MAC learning.  This option disables flow setup, so
              that every packet in the network passes through the controller.

              This option is most useful for debugging.  It reduces  switching
              performance, so it should not be used in production.

       <b>--max-idle=</b><u>secs</u>|<b>permanent</b>
              Sets  <u>secs</u>  as  the  number of seconds that a flow set up by the
              controller will remain in the switch's flow  table  without  any
              matching  packets  being seen.  If <b>permanent</b> is specified, which
              is not recommended, flows will never expire.  The default is  60
              seconds.

              This  option  has no effect when <b>-n</b> (or <b>--noflow</b>) is in use (be‐
              cause the controller does not set up flows in that case).

       <b>-H</b>
       <b>--hub</b>  By default, the controller acts as an  L2  MAC-learning  switch.
              This  option  changes  its behavior to that of a hub that floods
              packets on all but the incoming port.

              If <b>-H</b> (or <b>--hub</b>) and <b>-n</b> (or <b>--noflow</b>) are  used  together,  then
              the  cumulative  effect  is that every packet passes through the
              controller and every packet is flooded.

              This option is most useful for debugging.  It reduces  switching
              performance, so it should not be used in production.

       <b>-w</b>[<u>wildcard</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u>]
       <b>--wildcards</b>[<b>=</b><u>wildcard</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u>]
              By  default, <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> sets up exact-match flows.  This
              option allows it to set up wildcarded flows,  which  may  reduce
              flow  setup latency by causing less traffic to be sent up to the
              controller.

              The optional <u>wildcard</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u> is an OpenFlow  wildcard  bitmask  in
              hexadecimal  that specifies the fields to wildcard.  If no <u>wild‐</u>
              <u>card</u><b>_</b><u>mask</u> is specified, the default value 0x2820F0 is used which
              specifies L2-only switching and wildcards L3 and L4 fields.  An‐
              other interesting value is  0x2000EC,  which  specifies  L3-only
              switching and wildcards L2 and L4 fields.

              This  option  has no effect when <b>-n</b> (or <b>--noflow</b>) is in use (be‐
              cause the controller does not set up flows in that case).

       <b>-N</b>
       <b>--normal</b>
              By default, <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> directs packets to  a  particular
              port  or  floods  them.   This  option  causes it to direct non-
              flooded packets to the OpenFlow <b>OFPP_NORMAL</b> port.   This  allows
              the  switch  itself to make decisions about packet destinations.
              Support for <b>OFPP_NORMAL</b> is optional in OpenFlow, so this  option
              may not well with some non-Open vSwitch switches.

       <b>--mute</b> Prevents  ovs-testcontroller  from replying to any OpenFlow mes‐
              sages sent to it by switches.

              This option is only for debugging the Open  vSwitch  implementa‐
              tion of ``fail open'' mode.  It must not be used in production.

       <b>-q</b> <u>id</u>
       <b>--queue=</b><u>id</u>
              By  default,  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> uses the default OpenFlow queue
              for sending packets and setting up flows.  Use one of these  op‐
              tions, supplying <u>id</u> as an OpenFlow queue ID as a decimal number,
              to instead use that specific queue.

              This  option  is incompatible with <b>-N</b> or <b>--normal</b> and with <b>-H</b> or
              <b>--hub</b>.  If more than one is specified  then  this  option  takes
              precedence.

              This  option  may  be useful for testing or debugging quality of
              service setups.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>port-name</u><b>:</b><u>queue-id</u>

       <b>--port-queue</b> <u>port-name</u><b>:</b><u>queue-id</u>
              Configures packets received on the port  named  <u>port-name</u>  (e.g.
              <b>eth0</b>) to be output on OpenFlow queue ID <u>queue-id</u> (specified as a
              decimal  number).  For the specified port, this option overrides
              the default specified on <b>-q</b> or <b>--queue</b>.

              This option may be specified any number of times with  different
              <u>port-name</u> arguments.

              This  option  is incompatible with <b>-N</b> or <b>--normal</b> and with <b>-H</b> or
              <b>--hub</b>.  If more than one is specified  then  this  option  takes
              precedence.

              This  option  may  be useful for testing or debugging quality of
              service setups.

       <b>--with-flows</b> <u>file</u>
              When a switch connects, push the flow entries  as  described  in
              <u>file</u>.  Each line in <u>file</u> is a flow entry in the format described
              for  the  <b>add-flows</b>  command  in  the <b>Flow</b> <b>Syntax</b> section of the
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8) man page.

              Use this option more than once to add flows from multiple files.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented
              to it by SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that  SSL
              peers  use  to  verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--cer‐</b>
              <b>tificate</b>, or it may be a different one, depending on the PKI de‐
              sign in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables verification of certificates presented  by  SSL  peers.
              This  introduces a security risk, because it means that certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should be the
              CA certificate used to sign  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s  own  certifi‐
              cate, that is, the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>.
              If  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s certificate is self-signed, then <b>--cer‐</b>
              <b>tificate</b> and <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This option is not useful in normal operation, because  the  SSL
              peer  must  already have the CA certificate for the peer to have
              any confidence in <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s identity.  However,  this
              offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap the CA certifi‐
              cate on its first SSL connection.

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovs-testcontroller.pid</b>) to be created
              indicating the PID of the running process.  If the <u>pidfile</u> argu‐
              ment  is  not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it
              is created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the  specified  pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> refuses to start.   Specify  <b>--overwrite-pid‐</b>
              <b>file</b> to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  as  a background process.  The process
              forks, and in the child it starts  a  new  session,  closes  the
              standard  file  descriptors  (which  has the side effect of dis‐
              abling logging to the console), and changes its  current  direc‐
              tory  to  the  root (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).  After the
              child completes its initialization, the parent exits.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor the  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>
              daemon.   If  the  daemon  dies due to a signal that indicates a
              programming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>,  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  <b>SIGBUS</b>,  <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,
              <b>SIGPIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>, <b>SIGXCPU</b>, or <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process
              starts a new copy of it.  If the daemon dies or  exits  for  an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This  option  is  normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also func‐
              tions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By  default,  when  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>
              changes  its current working directory to the root directory af‐
              ter it detaches.  Otherwise, invoking <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> from  a
              carelessly chosen directory would prevent the administrator from
              unmounting the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying   <b>--no-chdir</b>  suppresses  this  behavior,  preventing
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b> from changing its current working  directory.
              This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common
              behavior  to write core dumps into the current working directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to  work  with
              files  under well-known directories determined during build.  It
              is better to stick with this default behavior  and  not  to  use
              this  flag  unless  some other Access Control is used to confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g.  DAC
              or  MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
              itself and hence should not be considered as a full  confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user</b> Causes  <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>  to run as a different user specified
              in "user:group", thus dropping  most  of  the  root  privileges.
              Short  forms  "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with current
              user or group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started  by
              the root user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before dropping root  privileges.  Daemons
              that  interact  with  a  datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be
              granted three  additional  capabilities,  namely  CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST  and  CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability change will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons, specifying this option will cause  the  daemon  process
              not to start.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.  (If <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  <b>ovs-testcon‐</b>
                     <b>troller</b>  closes its standard file descriptors, so logging
                     to the console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name   used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is  <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-testcontroller.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution needs to be taken into account, for ex‐
                     ample, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen  on
                     the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could
                     be interfering with local syslog traffic  and  there  are
                     some  security  considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>--unixctl=</b><u>socket</u>
              Sets  the name of the control socket on which <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>
              listens for runtime management commands (see <b>RUNTIME</b>  <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
              <b>COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <u>socket</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it is inter‐
              preted   as   relative  to  <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.   If
              <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, the  default  socket  is  <b>/usr/lo‐</b>
              <b>cal/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-testcontroller.</b><u>pid</u><b>.ctl</b>, where <u>pid</u> is
              <b>ovs-testcontroller</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement  commands.   A  file  is created in the absolute path as
              pointed by <u>socket</u> or if <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, a file  is
              created  as  <b>ovs-testcontroller.ctl</b> in the configured <u>OVS</u><b>_</b><u>RUNDIR</u>
              directory.  The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix
              domain socket.

              Specifying <b>none</b> for <u>socket</u> disables the control socket feature.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

       <b>-O</b> [<u>version</u>[<b>,</b><u>version</u>]...]
       <b>--protocols=</b>[<u>version</u>[<b>,</b><u>version</u>]...]
              Sets the OpenFlow protocol versions that are allowed when estab‐
              lishing an OpenFlow session.

              These protocol versions are enabled by default:

              •      <b>OpenFlow10</b>, for OpenFlow 1.0.
       The following protocol versions are generally supported, but  for  com‐
       patibility  with older versions of Open vSwitch they are not enabled by
       default:

              •      <b>OpenFlow11</b>, for OpenFlow 1.1.

              •      <b>OpenFlow12</b>, for OpenFlow 1.2.

              •      <b>OpenFlow13</b>, for OpenFlow 1.3.

              •      <b>OpenFlow14</b>, for OpenFlow 1.4.

              •      <b>OpenFlow15</b>, for OpenFlow 1.5.

       nections from OpenFlow switches:
