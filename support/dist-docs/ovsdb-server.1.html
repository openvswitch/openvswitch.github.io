<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>ovsdb-server</b> program provides RPC interfaces to one  or  more  Open
       vSwitch  databases  (OVSDBs).   It supports JSON-RPC client connections
       over active or passive TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets.  For an introduc‐
       tion to OVSDB and its implementation in Open vSwitch, see <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

       Each  OVSDB file may be specified on the command line as <u>database</u>.  Re‐
       lay  databases  may  be  specified  on  the   command   line   as   <u>re‐</u>
       <u>lay:schema</u><b>_</b><u>name:remote</u>.   For  a detailed description of relay database
       argument, see <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  If none of database files or  relay  databases
       is  specified,  the default is <b>/usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db</b>.  The
       database files must already have been created  and  initialized  using,
       for  example, <b>ovsdb-tool</b>'s <b>create</b>, <b>create-cluster</b>, or <b>join-cluster</b> com‐
       mand.

       This OVSDB implementation supports standalone, active-backup, relay and
       clustered  database  service  models,  as well as database replication.
       See the Service Models section of <b>ovsdb</b>(7) for more information.

       For clustered databases, when the <b>--detach</b> option is used, <b>ovsdb-server</b>
       detaches  without waiting for the server to successfully join a cluster
       (if the database file is freshly created with <b>ovsdb-tool</b>  <b>join-cluster</b>)
       or  connect  to a cluster that it has already joined.  Use <b>ovsdb-client</b>
       <b>wait</b> (see <b>ovsdb-client</b>(1)) to wait until the  server  has  successfully
       joined  and  connected  to a cluster.  The same is true for relay data‐
       bases.  Same commands could be used to wait for  a  relay  database  to
       connect to the relay source (remote).

       In  addition  to user-specified databases, <b>ovsdb-server</b> version 2.9 and
       later also always hosts a built-in database named <b>_Server</b>.  Please  see
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>(5) for documentation on this database's schema.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--remote=</b><u>remote</u>
              Adds  <u>remote</u>  as  a connection method used by <b>ovsdb-server</b>.  The
              <u>remote</u> may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method, e.g.
              <b>pssl:6640</b>,  as  described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  The following additional
              form is also supported:

              <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u>
                     Reads additional connection methods from <u>column</u> in all of
                     the  rows  in <u>table</u> within <u>db</u>.  As the contents of <u>column</u>
                     changes, <b>ovsdb-server</b>  also  adds  and  drops  connection
                     methods accordingly.

                     If  <u>column</u>'s  type  is string or set of strings, then the
                     connection methods are taken directly  from  the  column.
                     The connection methods in the column must have one of the
                     forms described above.

                     If <u>column</u>'s type is UUID or set of UUIDs and references a
                     table,  then each UUID is looked up in the referenced ta‐
                     ble to obtain a row.  The following columns in  the  row,
                     if  present  and of the correct type, configure a connec‐
                     tion method.  Any additional columns are ignored.

                     <b>target</b> (string)
                            Connection method, in one of the  forms  described
                            above.  This column is mandatory: if it is missing
                            or empty then no connection method can be  config‐
                            ured.

                     <b>max_backoff</b> (integer)
                            Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  to wait between
                            connection attempts.

                     <b>inactivity_probe</b> (integer)
                            Maximum number of milliseconds  of  idle  time  on
                            connection  to client before sending an inactivity
                            probe message.

                     <b>read_only</b> (boolean)
                            If true, only read-only transactions  are  allowed
                            on this connection.

                     It is an error for <u>column</u> to have another type.

              To  connect or listen on multiple connection methods, use multi‐
              ple <b>--remote</b> options.

       <b>--run=</b><u>command</u>]
              Ordinarily <b>ovsdb-server</b> runs forever, or until  it  is  told  to
              exit (see <b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  With this option,
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> instead starts a shell subprocess running  <u>command</u>.
              When  the  subprocess terminates, <b>ovsdb-server</b> also exits grace‐
              fully.  If the subprocess exits normally with exit code 0,  then
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>  exits  with  exit code 0 also; otherwise, it exits
              with exit code 1.

              This option can be useful where a database server is needed only
              to    run   a   single   command,   e.g.:   <b>ovsdb-server</b>   <b>--re‐</b>
              <b>mote=punix:socket</b>    <b>--run='ovsdb-client</b>    <b>dump</b>     <b>unix:socket</b>
              <b>Open_vSwitch'</b>

              This option is not supported on Windows platform.

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovsdb-server.pid</b>) to be created indi‐
              cating the PID of the running process.  If the <u>pidfile</u>  argument
              is  not  specified,  or  if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is
              created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the  specified  pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> refuses to start.  Specify  <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>  to
              cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  as a background process.  The process forks,
              and in the child it starts a new session,  closes  the  standard
              file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging
              to the console), and changes its current directory to  the  root
              (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).  After the child completes its
              initialization, the parent exits.   <b>ovsdb-server</b>  detaches  only
              after  it  starts  listening on all configured remotes.  At this
              point, all standalone and active-backup databases are ready  for
              use.   Clustered  databases only become ready for use after they
              finish joining their clusters (which could have already happened
              in previous runs of <b>ovsdb-server</b>).

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates  an  additional process to monitor the <b>ovsdb-server</b> dae‐
              mon.  If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates  a  pro‐
              gramming  error  (<b>SIGABRT</b>, <b>SIGALRM</b>, <b>SIGBUS</b>, <b>SIGFPE</b>, <b>SIGILL</b>, <b>SIG‐</b>
              <b>PIPE</b>, <b>SIGSEGV</b>, <b>SIGXCPU</b>, or <b>SIGXFSZ</b>)  then  the  monitor  process
              starts  a  new  copy of it.  If the daemon dies or exits for an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but  it  also  func‐
              tions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By default, when <b>--detach</b> is specified, <b>ovsdb-server</b> changes its
              current working directory to the root  directory  after  it  de‐
              taches.  Otherwise, invoking <b>ovsdb-server</b> from a carelessly cho‐
              sen directory would prevent the  administrator  from  unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying   <b>--no-chdir</b>  suppresses  this  behavior,  preventing
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> from changing its current working directory.   This
              may  be useful for collecting core files, since it is common be‐
              havior to write core dumps into the  current  working  directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By  default  daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with
              files under well-known directories determined during build.   It
              is  better  to  stick  with this default behavior and not to use
              this flag unless some other Access Control is  used  to  confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g.  DAC
              or  MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
              itself and hence should not be considered as a full  confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user</b> Causes <b>ovsdb-server</b> to run as  a  different  user  specified  in
              "user:group",  thus  dropping most of the root privileges. Short
              forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with current user or
              group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started by the root
              user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES  before  dropping root privileges. Daemons
              that interact with a datapath, such  as  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>,  will  be
              granted  three  additional  capabilities,  namely CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST and CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability  change  will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons, specifying this option will cause  the  daemon  process
              not to start.

   <b>Service</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid only on Windows platform.

       <b>--service</b>
              Causes  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  to run as a service in the background. The
              service should already have been created through external  tools
              like <b>SC.exe</b>.

       <b>--service-monitor</b>
              Causes the <b>ovsdb-server</b> service to be automatically restarted by
              the Windows services manager if the service dies  or  exits  for
              unexpected reasons.

              When <b>--service</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the  <b>vlog/list</b>  com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.  (If <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  <b>ovsdb-server</b>
                     closes  its  standard file descriptors, so logging to the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name   used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is  <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovsdb-server.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution needs to be taken into account, for ex‐
                     ample, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen  on
                     the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could
                     be interfering with local syslog traffic  and  there  are
                     some  security  considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

   <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Options</b>
       These  options support the <b>ovsdb-server</b> active-backup service model and
       database replication.  These options apply only  to  databases  in  the
       format  used  for  standalone and active-backup databases, which is the
       database format created by <b>ovsdb-tool</b>  <b>create</b>.   By  default,  when  it
       serves  a  database  in  this format, <b>ovsdb-server</b> runs as a standalone
       server.  These options can configure it for active-backup use:

       •      Use <b>--sync-from=</b><u>server</u> to start the server in the  backup  role,
              replicating data from <u>server</u>.  When <b>ovsdb-server</b> is running as a
              backup server, it rejects all transactions that can  modify  the
              database content, including lock commands.  The same form can be
              used to configure the local database as a replica of <u>server</u>.

       •      Use <b>--sync-from=</b><u>server</u> <b>--active</b> to start the server in  the  ac‐
              tive role, but prepared to switch to the backup role in which it
              would replicate data from <u>server</u>.  When <b>ovsdb-server</b> runs in ac‐
              tive mode, it allows all transactions, including those that mod‐
              ify the database.

       At runtime, management commands can change a server's role  and  other‐
       wise manage active-backup features.  See <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Commands</b>, below,
       for more information.

       <b>--sync-from=</b><u>server</u>
              Sets up <b>ovsdb-server</b> to synchronize its databases with the data‐
              bases  in  <u>server</u>,  which must be an active connection method in
              one of the forms documented in <b>ovsdb-client</b>(1).  Every  transac‐
              tion  committed  by  <u>server</u>  will be replicated to <b>ovsdb-server</b>.
              This option makes <b>ovsdb-server</b> start as  a  backup  server;  add
              <b>--active</b> to make it start as an active server.

       <b>--sync-exclude-tables=</b><u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>[<b>,</b><u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>]...
              Causes the specified tables to be excluded from replication.

       <b>--active</b>
              By  default, <b>--sync-from</b> makes <b>ovsdb-server</b> start up as a backup
              for <u>server</u>.  With <b>--active</b>, however, <b>ovsdb-server</b> starts  as  an
              active  server.  Use this option to allow the syncing options to
              be specified using command line options, yet start  the  server,
              as  the default, active server.  To switch the running server to
              backup mode, use <b>ovs-appctl(1)</b> to execute the  <b>ovsdb-server/con‐</b>
              <b>nect-active-ovsdb-server</b> command.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  options  described below for configuring the SSL public key infra‐
       structure accept a special syntax  for  obtaining  their  configuration
       from the database.  If any of these options is given <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u>
       as its argument, then the actual file name is read from  the  specified
       <u>column</u>  in  <u>table</u>  within  the  <u>db</u> database.  The <u>column</u> must have type
       string or set of strings.  The first nonempty string in  the  table  is
       taken as the file name.  (This means that ordinarily there should be at
       most one row in <u>table</u>.)

       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be  trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented to it
              by SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL  peers
              use  to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>,
              or it may be a different one, depending on  the  PKI  design  in
              use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates presented by SSL peers.
              This introduces a security risk, because it means that  certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              When <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>ovsdb-server</b> will attempt
              to  obtain the CA certificate from the SSL peer on its first SSL
              connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is success‐
              ful,  it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and
              from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a cer‐
              tificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              <b>This</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>exposes</b>  <b>the</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man-in-the-middle</b>
              <b>attack</b> <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be  use‐
              ful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certifi‐
              cate as part of the SSL certificate  chain.   The  SSL  protocol
              does not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM file that contains one or more additional cer‐
              tificates to send to SSL peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should  be  the
              CA certificate used to sign <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s own certificate, that
              is, the  certificate  specified  on  <b>-c</b>  or  <b>--certificate</b>.   If
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s  certificate  is  self-signed, then <b>--certificate</b>
              and <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This option is not useful in normal operation, because  the  SSL
              peer  must  already have the CA certificate for the peer to have
              any confidence in <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s identity.  However, this offers
              a  way for a new installation to bootstrap the CA certificate on
              its first SSL connection.

   <b>SSL</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--ssl-protocols=</b><u>protocols</u>
              Specifies, in a comma- or space-delimited list, the  SSL  proto‐
              cols  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  will  enable for SSL connections.  Supported
              <u>protocols</u> include <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1.1</b>, and  <b>TLSv1.2</b>.   Regardless  of
              order, the highest protocol supported by both sides will be cho‐
              sen when making the connection.  The default when this option is
              omitted is <b>TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2</b>.

       <b>--ssl-ciphers=</b><u>ciphers</u>
              Specifies,   in   OpenSSL  cipher  string  format,  the  ciphers
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> will support for SSL connections.  The default when
              this option is omitted is <b>HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5</b>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--unixctl=</b><u>socket</u>
              Sets  the  name of the control socket on which <b>ovsdb-server</b> lis‐
              tens for runtime management  commands  (see  <b>RUNTIME</b>  <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
              <b>COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <u>socket</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it is inter‐
              preted  as  relative  to   <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.    If
              <b>--unixctl</b>  is  not  used  at all, the default socket is <b>/usr/lo‐</b>
              <b>cal/var/run/openvswitch/ovsdb-server.</b><u>pid</u><b>.ctl</b>,   where   <u>pid</u>   is
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement commands.  A file is created in  the  absolute  path  as
              pointed  by <u>socket</u> or if <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, a file is
              created as <b>ovsdb-server.ctl</b> in the configured <u>OVS</u><b>_</b><u>RUNDIR</u>  direc‐
              tory.   The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix do‐
              main socket.

              Specifying <b>none</b> for <u>socket</u> disables the control socket feature.

       <b>--record[=</b><u>directory</u>]
              Sets the process in "recording" mode, in which  it  will  record
              all  the connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network
              sockets) and some other important necessary bits, so they  could
              be  replayed  later.  Recorded data is stored in replay files in
              specified <u>directory</u>.  If <u>directory</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it  is
              interpreted  as  relative to <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.  If
              <u>directory</u> is not specified, <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>  will
              be used.

       <b>--replay[=</b><u>directory</u>]
              Sets  the process in "replay" mode, in which it will read infor‐
              mation about connections, data from  streams  (Unix  domain  and
              network sockets) and some other necessary bits directly from re‐
              play files instead of using real sockets.  Replay files from the
              <u>directory</u>  will be used.  If <u>directory</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it
              is interpreted as  relative  to  <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.
              If  <u>directory</u>  is  not specified, <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>
              will be used.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) can send commands to a running <b>ovsdb-server</b> process.  The
       currently supported commands are described below.

   <b>ovsdb-server</b> Commands
       These commands are specific to <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       <b>exit</b>   Causes <b>ovsdb-server</b> to gracefully terminate.

       <b>ovsdb-server/compact</b> [<u>db</u>]
              Compacts database <u>db</u> in-place.  If <u>db</u> is not specified, compacts
              every database in-place.  A database is also compacted automati‐
              cally  when  a  transaction  is  logged if it is over 2 times as
              large as its previous compacted size (and at least 10  MB),  but
              not  before  100  commits  have  been  added  or 10 minutes have
              elapsed since the last compaction. It will also be compacted au‐
              tomatically after 24 hours since the last compaction if 100 com‐
              mits were added regardless of its size.

       <b>ovsdb-server/memory-trim-on-compaction</b> <u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              If this option is <u>on</u>, ovsdb-server will try to reclaim  all  un‐
              used  heap memory back to the system after each successful data‐
              base compaction to reduce the memory consumption of the process.
              <u>off</u> by default.

       <b>ovsdb-server/reconnect</b>
              Makes <b>ovsdb-server</b> drop all of the JSON-RPC connections to data‐
              base clients and reconnect.

              This command might be useful for debugging issues with  database
              clients.

       <b>ovsdb-server/add-remote</b> <u>remote</u>
              Adds  a  remote, as if <b>--remote=</b><u>remote</u> had been specified on the
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> command line.  (If <u>remote</u> is already a remote, this
              command succeeds without changing the configuration.)

       <b>ovsdb-server/remove-remote</b> <u>remote</u>
              Removes  the  specified  <u>remote</u>  from the configuration, failing
              with an error if <u>remote</u> is not configured  as  a  remote.   This
              command  only  works with remotes that were named on <b>--remote</b> or
              <b>ovsdb-server/add-remote</b>, that is, it  will  not  remove  remotes
              added  indirectly  because  they  were read from the database by
              configuring a <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u>  remote.   (You  can  remove  a
              database source with <b>ovsdb-server/remove-remote</b> <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>col‐</u>
              <u>umn</u>, but not individual remotes  found  indirectly  through  the
              database.)

       <b>ovsdb-server/list-remotes</b>
              Outputs  a  list  of  the  currently configured remotes named on
              <b>--remote</b> or <b>ovsdb-server/add-remote</b>, that is, it does  not  list
              remotes  added  indirectly because they were read from the data‐
              base by configuring a <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u> remote.

       <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b> <u>database</u>
              Adds the <u>database</u> to the running <b>ovsdb-server</b>.   <u>database</u>  could
              be  a database file or a relay description in the following for‐
              mat: <u>relay:schema</u><b>_</b><u>name:remote</u>.  The database file  must  already
              have been created and initialized using, for example, <b>ovsdb-tool</b>
              <b>create</b>.

       <b>ovsdb-server/remove-db</b> <u>database</u>
              Removes <u>database</u> from the running <b>ovsdb-server</b>.   <u>database</u>  must
              be a database name as listed by <b>ovsdb-server/list-dbs</b>.

              If  a  remote  has  been configured that points to the specified
              <u>database</u> (e.g. <b>--remote=db:</b><u>database</u><b>,</b>... on  the  command  line),
              then  it  will  be disabled until another database with the same
              name is added again (with <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b>).

              Any public key infrastructure  options  specified  through  this
              database  (e.g.  <b>--private-key=db:</b><u>database,</u>...  on  the  command
              line) will be disabled until another database with the same name
              is added again (with <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b>).

       <b>ovsdb-server/list-dbs</b>
              Outputs  a  list of the currently configured databases added ei‐
              ther through the command line or through the <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b>
              command.

       <b>ovsdb-server/tlog-set</b> <u>database</u>:<u>table</u> <u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              Enables  or  disables  logging of all operations executed on the
              specified database and table.  Logs are generated at INFO  level
              and are rate limtied.

       <b>ovsdb-server/tlog-list</b>
              Displays  the  logging  state for all currently configured data‐
              bases and tables.

   <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and update the role of <b>ovsdb-server</b> within an  ac‐
       tive-backup pair of servers.  See <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Options</b>, above, and <b>Ac‐</b>
       <b>tive-Backup</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Model</b> in <b>ovsdb</b>(7) for more information.

       <b>ovsdb-server/set-active-ovsdb-server</b> <u>server</u>
              Sets  the active <u>server</u> from which <b>ovsdb-server</b> connects through
              <b>ovsdb-server/connect-active-ovsdb-server</b>.   This  overrides  the
              <b>--sync-from</b> command-line option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/get-active-ovsdb-server</b>
              Gets the active server from which <b>ovsdb-server</b> is currently syn‐
              chronizing its databases.

       <b>ovsdb-server/connect-active-ovsdb-server</b>
              Switches  the  server  to a backup role.  The server starts syn‐
              chronizing its databases with the  active  server  specified  by
              <b>ovsdb-server/set-active-ovsdb-server</b>  (or  the  <b>--sync-from</b> com‐
              mand-line option) and closes all  existing  client  connections,
              which requires clients to reconnect.

       <b>ovsdb-server/disconnect-active-ovsdb-server</b>
              Switches  the  server  to an active role.  The server stops syn‐
              chronizing its databases with an active server  and  closes  all
              existing  client  connections,  which requires clients to recon‐
              nect.

       <b>ovsdb-server/set-active-ovsdb-server-probe-interval</b> <u>probe</u> <u>interval</u>
              Sets  the probe interval (in milli seconds) for  the  connection
              to active <u>server</u>.

       <b>ovsdb-server/set-sync-exclude-tables</b> <u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>[<b>,</b><u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>]...
              Sets the <u>table</u> within <u>db</u> that will be excluded from synchroniza‐
              tion.  This overrides the <b>--sync-exclude-tables</b> command-line op‐
              tion.

       <b>ovsdb-server/get-sync-exclude-tables</b>
              Gets  the  tables  that are currently excluded from synchroniza‐
              tion.

       <b>ovsdb-server/sync-status</b>
              Prints a summary of replication run time information. The  <b>state</b>
              information is always provided, indicating whether the server is
              running in the <u>active</u> or  the  <u>backup</u>  mode.   When  running  in
              backup  mode, replication connection status, which can be either
              <u>connecting</u>, <u>replicating</u> or <u>error</u>, are shown.  When  the  connec‐
              tion  is  in <u>replicating</u> state, further output shows the list of
              databases currently replicating, and the  tables  that  are  ex‐
              cluded.

   <b>Cluster</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These  commands support the <b>ovsdb-server</b> clustered service model.  They
       apply only to databases in the format  used  for  clustered  databases,
       which  is  the database format created by <b>ovsdb-tool</b> <b>create-cluster</b> and
       <b>ovsdb-tool</b> <b>join-cluster</b>.

       <b>cluster/cid</b> <u>db</u>
              Prints the cluster ID for <u>db</u>, which is a  UUID  that  identifies
              the  cluster.   If  <u>db</u> is a database newly created by <b>ovsdb-tool</b>
              <b>cluster-join</b> that has not yet successfully joined  its  cluster,
              and  <b>--cid</b>  was  not specified on the <b>cluster-join</b> command line,
              then this command will report an error because the cluster ID is
              not yet known.

       <b>cluster/sid</b> <u>db</u>
              Prints  the  server  ID  for <u>db</u>, which is a UUID that identifies
              this server within the cluster.

       <b>cluster/status</b> <u>db</u>
              Prints this server's status within the cluster and the status of
              its connections to other servers in the cluster.

       <b>cluster/leave</b> <u>db</u>
              This  command  starts the server gracefully removing itself from
              its cluster.  At least one server must remain, and  the  cluster
              must  be  healthy,  that  is, over half of the cluster's servers
              must be up.

              When the server successfully leaves the cluster, it stops  serv‐
              ing <u>db</u>, as if <b>ovsdb-server/remove-db</b> <u>db</u> had been executed.

              Use  <b>ovsdb-client</b>  <b>wait</b>  (see <b>ovsdb-client</b>(1)) to wait until the
              server has left the cluster.

              Once a server leaves a cluster, it may  never  rejoin  it.   In‐
              stead, create a new server and join it to the cluster.

              Note  that removing the server from the cluster alters the total
              size of the cluster. For example, if you remove two servers from
              a  three  server  cluster,  then  the "cluster" becomes a single
              functioning server.  This does not  result  in  a  three  server
              cluster that lacks quorum.

       <b>cluster/kick</b> <u>db</u> <u>server</u>
              Start  graceful  removal of <u>server</u> from <u>db</u>'s cluster, like <b>clus‐</b>
              <b>ter/leave</b> (without  <b>--force</b>)  except  that  it  can  remove  any
              server, not just this one.

              <u>server</u>  may  be  a  server ID, as printed by <b>cluster/sid</b>, or the
              server's local network address as passed  to  <b>ovsdb-tool</b>'s  <b>cre‐</b>
              <b>ate-cluster</b>  or <b>join-cluster</b> command.  Use <b>cluster/status</b> to see
              a list of cluster members.

       <b>cluster/change-election-timer</b> <u>db</u> <u>time</u>
              Change the leader election timeout base value of the cluster, in
              milliseconds.

              Leader  election  will be initiated by a follower if there is no
              heartbeat received from the leader within this time plus a  ran‐
              dom time within 1 second.

              The  default  value  is  1000, if not changed with this command.
              This command can be used to adjust the value when necessary, ac‐
              cording to the expected load and response time of the servers.

              This  command  must be executed on the leader.  It initiates the
              change to the cluster.  To see if the change takes effect  (com‐
              mitted), use <b>cluster/status</b> to show the current setting.  Once a
              change is committed, it persists at server restarts.

       <b>cluster/set-backlog-threshold</b> <u>db</u> <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>msgs</u> <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>bytes</u>
              Sets the backlog limits for <u>db</u>'s RAFT connections to  a  maximum
              of  <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>msgs</u>  messages or <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>bytes</u> bytes.  If the backlog on one of
              the connections reaches the limit, it will be disconnected  (and
              re-established).   Values  are  checked only if the backlog con‐
              tains more than 50 messages.

   <b>VLOG</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s logging settings.

       <b>vlog/set</b> [<u>spec</u>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>,  or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.

                     On  Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  <b>--syslog-target</b>  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>,  <b>emer</b>,  <b>err</b>,  <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  <b>off</b> filters out all  messages.   See  <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file
              will not take place unless <b>ovsdb-server</b>  was  invoked  with  the
              <b>--log-file</b> option.

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>vlog/set</b> <b>PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>vlog/list</b>
              Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.

       <b>vlog/list-pattern</b>
              Lists logging patterns used for each destination.

       <b>vlog/close</b>
              Causes  <b>ovsdb-server</b> to close its log file, if it is open.  (Use
              <b>vlog/reopen</b> to reopen it later.)

       <b>vlog/reopen</b>
              Causes <b>ovsdb-server</b> to close its log file, if it  is  open,  and
              then  reopen  it.   (This is useful after rotating log files, to
              cause a new log file to be used.)

              This has no effect unless  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  was  invoked  with  the
              <b>--log-file</b> option.

       <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b> [<u>module</u>]...
       <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit</b> [<u>module</u>]...
              By  default,  <b>ovsdb-server</b> limits the rate at which certain mes‐
              sages can be logged.  When a  message  would  appear  more  fre‐
              quently  than  the  limit,  it  is  suppressed.  This saves disk
              space, makes logs easier to read, and speeds up  execution,  but
              occasionally  troubleshooting  requires more detail.  Therefore,
              <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b> allows rate limits to be disabled at the
              level  of  an individual log module.  Specify one or more module
              names, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command.  Specifying either
              no  module  names at all or the keyword <b>any</b> disables rate limits
              for every log module.

              The <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit</b> command, whose syntax is the same  as
              <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b>,  can  be used to re-enable a rate limit
              that was previously disabled.

   <b>MEMORY</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands report memory usage.

       <b>memory/show</b>
              Displays some basic statistics about <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s  memory  us‐
              age.  <b>ovsdb-server</b> also logs this information soon after startup
              and periodically as its memory consumption grows.

   <b>COVERAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s ``coverage counters,'' which count
       the  number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
       In addition to these commands, <b>ovsdb-server</b> automatically logs coverage
       counter  values,  at <b>INFO</b> level, when it detects that the daemon's main
       loop takes unusually long to run.

       Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and debug‐
       ging.

       <b>coverage/show</b>
              Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds,
              the last minute and the last hour, and the total counts  of  all
              of the coverage counters.

       <b>coverage/read-counter</b> <u>counter</u>
              Displays the total count for the given coverage <u>counter</u>.

<b>BUGS</b>
       In Open vSwitch before version 2.4, when <b>ovsdb-server</b> sent JSON-RPC er‐
       ror responses to some requests, it incorrectly formulated them with the
       <b>result</b>  and  <b>error</b>  swapped,  so that the response appeared to indicate
       success (with a nonsensical result) rather than an error.  The requests
       that suffered from this problem were:

       <b>transact</b>
       <b>get_schema</b>
              Only if the request names a nonexistent database.

       <b>monitor</b>
       <b>lock</b>
       <b>unlock</b> In all error cases.

       Of  these  cases,  the  only  error  that a well-written application is
       likely to encounter in practice is <b>monitor</b> of tables or columns that do
       not  exist, in an situation where the application has been upgraded but
       the old database schema is still temporarily in use.   To  handle  this
       situation  gracefully, we recommend that clients should treat a <b>monitor</b>
       response with a <b>result</b> that contains an <b>error</b> key-value pair as an  er‐
       ror  (assuming that the database being monitored does not contain a ta‐
       ble named <b>error</b>).
