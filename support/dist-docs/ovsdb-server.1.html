<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>ovsdb-server</b> program provides RPC interfaces to one  or  more  Open
       vSwitch  databases  (OVSDBs).   It supports JSON-RPC client connections
       over active or passive TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets.  For an introduc‐
       tion to OVSDB and its implementation in Open vSwitch, see <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

       Each OVSDB file may be specified on the command line as <u>database</u>.   Re‐
       lay   databases   may   be   specified  on  the  command  line  as  <u>re‐</u>
       <u>lay:schema</u><b>_</b><u>name:remote</u>.  For a detailed description of  relay  database
       argument,  see  <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  If none of database files or relay databases
       is specified, the default is  <b>/usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db</b>.   The
       database  files  must  already have been created and initialized using,
       for example, <b>ovsdb-tool</b>'s <b>create</b>, <b>create-cluster</b>, or <b>join-cluster</b>  com‐
       mand.

       All types of databases can alternatively be added using a configuration
       file provided via <b>--config-file</b> option.  This option is mutually exclu‐
       sive  with specifying <u>database</u> on the command line.  For a detailed de‐
       scription of the configuration file format see <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

       This OVSDB implementation supports standalone, active-backup, relay and
       clustered database service models, as  well  as  database  replication.
       See the Service Models section of <b>ovsdb</b>(7) for more information.

       For clustered databases, when the <b>--detach</b> option is used, <b>ovsdb-server</b>
       detaches  without waiting for the server to successfully join a cluster
       (if the database file is freshly created with <b>ovsdb-tool</b>  <b>join-cluster</b>)
       or  connect  to a cluster that it has already joined.  Use <b>ovsdb-client</b>
       <b>wait</b> (see <b>ovsdb-client</b>(1)) to wait until the  server  has  successfully
       joined  and  connected  to a cluster.  The same is true for relay data‐
       bases.  Same commands could be used to wait for  a  relay  database  to
       connect to the relay source (remote).

       In  addition  to user-specified databases, <b>ovsdb-server</b> version 2.9 and
       later also always hosts a built-in database named <b>_Server</b>.  Please  see
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>(5) for documentation on this database's schema.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--remote=</b><u>remote</u>
              Adds  <u>remote</u>  as  a connection method used by <b>ovsdb-server</b>.  The
              <u>remote</u> may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method, e.g.
              <b>pssl:6640</b>, as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  The  following  additional
              form is also supported:

              <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u>
                     Reads additional connection methods from <u>column</u> in all of
                     the  rows  in <u>table</u> within <u>db</u>.  As the contents of <u>column</u>
                     changes, <b>ovsdb-server</b>  also  adds  and  drops  connection
                     methods accordingly.

                     If  <u>column</u>'s  type  is string or set of strings, then the
                     connection methods are taken directly  from  the  column.
                     The connection methods in the column must have one of the
                     forms described above.

                     If <u>column</u>'s type is UUID or set of UUIDs and references a
                     table,  then each UUID is looked up in the referenced ta‐
                     ble to obtain a row.  The following columns in  the  row,
                     if  present  and of the correct type, configure a connec‐
                     tion method.  Any additional columns are ignored.

                     <b>target</b> (string)
                            Connection method, in one of the  forms  described
                            above.  This column is mandatory: if it is missing
                            or  empty then no connection method can be config‐
                            ured.

                     <b>max_backoff</b> (integer)
                            Maximum number of  milliseconds  to  wait  between
                            connection attempts.

                     <b>inactivity_probe</b> (integer)
                            Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  of idle time on
                            connection to client before sending an  inactivity
                            probe message.

                     <b>read_only</b> (boolean)
                            If  true,  only read-only transactions are allowed
                            on this connection.

                     It is an error for <u>column</u> to have another type.

              To connect or listen on multiple connection methods, use  multi‐
              ple <b>--remote</b> options.

              Alternatively,  remotes  can be specified in a "remotes" section
              of the configuration file, if provided using  <b>--config-file</b>  op‐
              tion.   <b>--config-file</b>  and  <b>--remote</b> options are mutually exclu‐
              sive.

       <b>--config-file=</b><u>file</u>
              Specifies a configuration file for <b>ovsdb-server</b>.  This <u>file</u>  can
              contain  connection  methods  and  databases used by the server.
              The <u>file</u> contains a JSON object with two main elements:

              <b>remotes</b>
                     JSON object that contains a set of connection methods  in
                     the following format: "<u>target</u>": { "<u>option</u>": <u>value</u>, ... }.
                     Where  <u>target</u> is in the same format as <u>remote</u> in <b>--remote</b>
                     option.  <u>option</u> can be <b>max-backoff</b> (integer), <b>inactivity-</b>
                     <b>probe</b> (integer), <b>read-only</b> (boolean),  <b>role</b>  (string)  or
                     <b>dscp</b>  (integer)  with  their allowed <u>value</u>s respectively.
                     The meaning of these <u>option</u>s is the same as in configura‐
                     tion of <u>remote</u> via a database row with <b>--remote</b> option.

              <b>databases</b>
                     JSON object that describes databases that should be added
                     to the <b>ovsdb-server</b> in  the  following  format:  "<u>name</u>":{
                     "<u>option</u>": <u>value</u>, ... }.  Where <u>name</u> is either a file name
                     of  a  previously  created  and initialized database or a
                     schema name in case of relay  databases.   Available  <u>op‐</u>
                     <u>tion</u>s are:

                     <b>service-model</b> (string)
                            Describes the service model of this database.  One
                            of: <b>standalone</b>, <b>clustered</b>, <b>active-backup</b> or <b>relay</b>.
                            This  option is required for all types, except for
                            standalone and clustered.  For these databases the
                            service model will be inferred from the  file,  if
                            not   specified   explicitly.   <b>ovsdb-server</b>  will
                            refuse to add a database if the specified <b>service-</b>
                            <b>model</b> doesn't match with the provided file.

                     <b>source</b> (JSON object; active-backup or relay)
                            Describes the  connection  method  to  the  active
                            database or to the relay source.  It is a JSON ob‐
                            ject  with  exactly one element in the same format
                            as elements of "<b>remotes</b>",  except  that  <b>read-only</b>
                            and   <b>role</b>   options  are  not  applicable.   E.g.
                            <b>"source":</b> <b>{</b> <b>"unix:db.sock":</b> <b>{</b>  <b>"inactivity-probe":</b>
                            <b>10000,</b> <b>"max-backoff":</b> <b>8000</b> <b>}</b> <b>}</b>

                     <b>backup</b> (boolean; active-backup only)
                            If  set  to <b>true</b>, <b>ovsdb-server</b> will use this data‐
                            base as a backup for the specified  <b>source</b>.   Will
                            be served as an active database otherwise.

                     <b>exclude-tables</b> (JSON array of strings; active-backup
                     only)
                            List  of  table names that should be excluded from
                            replication in backup mode, e.g. <b>"exclude-tables":</b>
                            <b>[</b> <b>"Table_One",</b> <b>"Table_Two"</b> <b>]</b>.

              Content of the most basic configuration file may look like this:
              <b>{</b> <b>"remotes":</b> <b>{</b> <b>"pssl:6640":</b> <b>{}</b> <b>},</b> <b>"databases":</b> <b>{</b> <b>"conf.db":</b> <b>{}</b> <b>}</b>
              <b>}</b>

              Examples of configuration files for different service models can
              be found in in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

              <b>--config-file</b> option is mutually exclusive with the <b>--remote</b>  as
              well  as with specifying <u>database</u> on a command line.  It is also
              mutually exclusive with all the <b>Active-Backup</b>  <b>Options</b>  and  all
              the  <b>RUNTIME</b>  <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> that can change the configura‐
              tion of the server in conflict with the  content  of  the  file,
              i.e.  all  the  commands  that manipulate with remotes and data‐
              bases.  Read-only commands can still be used.

              In case of changes in the <u>file</u>,  users  should  run  the  <b>ovsdb-</b>
              <b>server/reload</b> command with <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) in order for changes to
              take effect.

       <b>--run=</b><u>command</u>]
              Ordinarily  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  runs  forever,  or until it is told to
              exit (see <b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below).  With this option,
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> instead starts a shell subprocess running  <u>command</u>.
              When  the  subprocess terminates, <b>ovsdb-server</b> also exits grace‐
              fully.  If the subprocess exits normally with exit code 0,  then
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>  exits  with  exit code 0 also; otherwise, it exits
              with exit code 1.

              This option can be useful where a database server is needed only
              to   run   a   single   command,   e.g.:   <b>ovsdb-server</b>    <b>--re‐</b>
              <b>mote=punix:socket</b>     <b>--run='ovsdb-client</b>    <b>dump</b>    <b>unix:socket</b>
              <b>Open_vSwitch'</b>

              This option is not supported on Windows platform.

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovsdb-server.pid</b>) to be created indi‐
              cating the PID of the running process.  If the <u>pidfile</u>  argument
              is  not  specified,  or  if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is
              created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the  specified  pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> refuses to start.  Specify  <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>  to
              cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  as a background process.  The process forks,
              and in the child it starts a new session,  closes  the  standard
              file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging
              to  the  console), and changes its current directory to the root
              (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).  After the child completes its
              initialization, the parent exits.   <b>ovsdb-server</b>  detaches  only
              after  it  starts  listening on all configured remotes.  At this
              point, all standalone and active-backup databases are ready  for
              use.   Clustered  databases only become ready for use after they
              finish joining their clusters (which could have already happened
              in previous runs of <b>ovsdb-server</b>).

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor the  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  dae‐
              mon.   If  the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a pro‐
              gramming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>, <b>SIGALRM</b>, <b>SIGBUS</b>, <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,  <b>SIG‐</b>
              <b>PIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>,  <b>SIGXCPU</b>,  or  <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process
              starts a new copy of it.  If the daemon dies or  exits  for  an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This  option  is  normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also func‐
              tions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By default, when <b>--detach</b> is specified, <b>ovsdb-server</b> changes its
              current working directory to the root  directory  after  it  de‐
              taches.  Otherwise, invoking <b>ovsdb-server</b> from a carelessly cho‐
              sen  directory  would  prevent the administrator from unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying  <b>--no-chdir</b>  suppresses  this  behavior,   preventing
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>  from changing its current working directory.  This
              may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common  be‐
              havior  to  write  core dumps into the current working directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to  work  with
              files  under well-known directories determined during build.  It
              is better to stick with this default behavior  and  not  to  use
              this  flag  unless  some other Access Control is used to confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g.  DAC
              or  MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
              itself and hence should not be considered as a full  confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user</b> Causes  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  to  run  as  a different user specified in
              "user:group", thus dropping most of the root  privileges.  Short
              forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with current user or
              group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started by the root
              user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before dropping root  privileges.  Daemons
              that  interact  with  a  datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be
              granted three  additional  capabilities,  namely  CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST  and  CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability change will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons, specifying this option will cause  the  daemon  process
              not to start.

   <b>Service</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid only on Windows platform.

       <b>--service</b>
              Causes  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  to run as a service in the background. The
              service should already have been created through external  tools
              like <b>SC.exe</b>.

       <b>--service-monitor</b>
              Causes the <b>ovsdb-server</b> service to be automatically restarted by
              the  Windows  services  manager if the service dies or exits for
              unexpected reasons.

              When <b>--service</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the  <b>vlog/list</b>  com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>,  or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.   (If  <b>--detach</b>  is specified, <b>ovsdb-server</b>
                     closes its standard file descriptors, so logging  to  the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On  Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  <b>--syslog-target</b>  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>,  <b>emer</b>,  <b>err</b>,  <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  <b>off</b> filters out all  messages.   See  <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to <u>pattern</u>.  Refer to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message.  <u>facility</u>  can  be
              one  of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,  <b>local1</b>,  <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>,  <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not
              specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for  the  local  system
              syslog  and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <u>file</u> is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name  used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is   <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovsdb-server.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options  is  that libc adds fixed prefix to every message
                     before it is actually sent  to  the  syslog  daemon  over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However,  <b>rsyslogd</b>  <b>8.9</b> and older versions use hard coded
                     parser function anyway that  limits  UNIX  domain  socket
                     use.   If  you  want to use arbitrary message format with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible to use arbitrary message  format  also  with  older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.   When  sending syslog messages over UDP socket
                     extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for  ex‐
                     ample,  syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
                     the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could
                     be  interfering  with  local syslog traffic and there are
                     some security considerations that apply to  UDP  sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The  default  is  taken  from  the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

   <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options support the <b>ovsdb-server</b> active-backup service model  and
       database  replication.   These  options  apply only to databases in the
       format used for standalone and active-backup databases,  which  is  the
       database  format  created  by  <b>ovsdb-tool</b>  <b>create</b>.  By default, when it
       serves a database in this format, <b>ovsdb-server</b>  runs  as  a  standalone
       server.  These options can configure it for active-backup use:

       •      Use  <b>--sync-from=</b><u>server</u>  to start the server in the backup role,
              replicating data from <u>server</u>.  When <b>ovsdb-server</b> is running as a
              backup server, it rejects all transactions that can  modify  the
              database content, including lock commands.  The same form can be
              used to configure the local database as a replica of <u>server</u>.

       •      Use  <b>--sync-from=</b><u>server</u>  <b>--active</b> to start the server in the ac‐
              tive role, but prepared to switch to the backup role in which it
              would replicate data from <u>server</u>.  When <b>ovsdb-server</b> runs in ac‐
              tive mode, it allows all transactions, including those that mod‐
              ify the database.

       At runtime, management commands can change a server's role  and  other‐
       wise manage active-backup features.  See <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Commands</b>, below,
       for more information.

       <b>--sync-from=</b><u>server</u>
              Sets up <b>ovsdb-server</b> to synchronize its databases with the data‐
              bases  in  <u>server</u>,  which must be an active connection method in
              one of the forms documented in <b>ovsdb-client</b>(1).  Every  transac‐
              tion  committed  by  <u>server</u>  will be replicated to <b>ovsdb-server</b>.
              This option makes <b>ovsdb-server</b> start as  a  backup  server;  add
              <b>--active</b> to make it start as an active server.

       <b>--sync-exclude-tables=</b><u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>[<b>,</b><u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>]...
              Causes the specified tables to be excluded from replication.

       <b>--active</b>
              By  default, <b>--sync-from</b> makes <b>ovsdb-server</b> start up as a backup
              for <u>server</u>.  With <b>--active</b>, however, <b>ovsdb-server</b> starts  as  an
              active  server.  Use this option to allow the syncing options to
              be specified using command line options, yet start  the  server,
              as  the default, active server.  To switch the running server to
              backup mode, use <b>ovs-appctl(1)</b> to execute the  <b>ovsdb-server/con‐</b>
              <b>nect-active-ovsdb-server</b> command.

       These options are mutually exclusive with the <b>--config-file</b>.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  options  described below for configuring the SSL public key infra‐
       structure accept a special syntax  for  obtaining  their  configuration
       from the database.  If any of these options is given <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u>
       as  its  argument, then the actual file name is read from the specified
       <u>column</u> in <u>table</u> within the <u>db</u> database.   The  <u>column</u>  must  have  type
       string  or  set  of strings.  The first nonempty string in the table is
       taken as the file name.  (This means that ordinarily there should be at
       most one row in <u>table</u>.)

       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented to it
              by SSL/TLS peers.   (This  may  be  the  same  certificate  that
              SSL/TLS  peers  use to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or
              <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one,  depending  on  the
              PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it  means  that
              certificates  cannot  be  verified  to be those of known trusted
              hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              When <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>ovsdb-server</b> will attempt
              to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL/TLS peer on its  first
              SSL/TLS  connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is
              successful, it will immediately drop the connection  and  recon‐
              nect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be authenti‐
              cated  by  a  certificate  signed by the CA certificate thus ob‐
              tained.

              <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b>  <b>man-in-the-mid‐</b>
              <b>dle</b>  <b>attack</b>  <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be
              useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA cer‐
              tificate as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS pro‐
              tocols do not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL/TLS peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should be
              the CA certificate used to sign <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s own  certificate,
              that  is,  the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>.  If
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s certificate is  self-signed,  then  <b>--certificate</b>
              and <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This  option  is  not  useful  in  normal operation, because the
              SSL/TLS peer must already have the CA certificate for  the  peer
              to  have  any  confidence  in <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s identity.  However,
              this offers a way for a new installation  to  bootstrap  the  CA
              certificate on its first SSL/TLS connection.

   <b>SSL</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--ssl-protocols=</b><u>protocols</u>
              Specifies  a  range  or  a comma- or space-delimited list of the
              SSL/TLS protocols <b>ovsdb-server</b> will enable for  SSL/TLS  connec‐
              tions.   Supported <u>protocols</u> include <b>TLSv1</b> (deprecated), <b>TLSv1.1</b>
              (deprecated), <b>TLSv1.2</b> and <b>TLSv1.3</b>.  Ranges can be provided in  a
              form of two protocol names separated with a dash, or as a single
              protocol   name   with   a   plus   sign.    For   example,  use
              <b>TLSv1.1-TLSv1.3</b> to allow  <b>TLSv1.1</b>,  <b>TLSv1.2</b>  and  <b>TLSv1.3</b>.   Use
              <b>TLSv1.2+</b>  to  allow  <b>TLSv1.2</b> and any later protocol.  The option
              accepts a list of protocols or exactly one range.  The range  is
              a  preferred  way  of specifying protocols and the option always
              behaves as if the range between  the  minimum  and  the  maximum
              specified  version  is  provided,  i.e., if the option is set to
              <b>TLSv1.1,TLSv1.3</b>, the <b>TLSv1.2</b> will also be enabled as if it was a
              range.  Regardless of order, the highest protocol  supported  by
              both  sides  will be chosen when making the connection.  The de‐
              fault when this option is omitted is <b>TLSv1.2</b> or later.

       <b>--ssl-ciphers=</b><u>ciphers</u>
              Specifies,  in  OpenSSL  cipher  string  format,   the   ciphers
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>  will  support for SSL/TLS connections with TLSv1.2
              and earlier.  The default when this option  is  omitted  is  <b>DE‐</b>
              <b>FAULT:@SECLEVEL=2</b>.

       <b>--ssl-ciphersuites=</b><u>ciphersuites</u>
              Specifies,  in  OpenSSL  ciphersuite  string format, the cipher‐
              suites <b>ovsdb-server</b> will support for  SSL/TLS  connections  with
              TLSv1.3 and later.  Default value from OpenSSL will be used when
              this option is omitted.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--unixctl=</b><u>socket</u>
              Sets  the  name of the control socket on which <b>ovsdb-server</b> lis‐
              tens for runtime management  commands  (see  <b>RUNTIME</b>  <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
              <b>COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <u>socket</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it is inter‐
              preted   as   relative  to  <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.   If
              <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, the  default  socket  is  <b>/usr/lo‐</b>
              <b>cal/var/run/openvswitch/ovsdb-server.</b><u>pid</u><b>.ctl</b>,   where   <u>pid</u>   is
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement commands.  A file is created in  the  absolute  path  as
              pointed  by <u>socket</u> or if <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, a file is
              created as <b>ovsdb-server.ctl</b> in the configured <u>OVS</u><b>_</b><u>RUNDIR</u>  direc‐
              tory.   The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix do‐
              main socket.

              Specifying <b>none</b> for <u>socket</u> disables the control socket feature.

       <b>--record[=</b><u>directory</u>]
              Sets the process in "recording" mode, in which  it  will  record
              all  the connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network
              sockets) and some other important necessary bits, so they  could
              be  replayed  later.  Recorded data is stored in replay files in
              specified <u>directory</u>.  If <u>directory</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it  is
              interpreted  as  relative to <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.  If
              <u>directory</u> is not specified, <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>  will
              be used.

       <b>--replay[=</b><u>directory</u>]
              Sets  the process in "replay" mode, in which it will read infor‐
              mation about connections, data from  streams  (Unix  domain  and
              network sockets) and some other necessary bits directly from re‐
              play files instead of using real sockets.  Replay files from the
              <u>directory</u>  will be used.  If <u>directory</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it
              is interpreted as  relative  to  <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.
              If  <u>directory</u>  is  not specified, <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>
              will be used.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) can send commands to a running <b>ovsdb-server</b> process.  The
       currently supported commands are described below.

   <b>ovsdb-server</b> Commands
       These commands are specific to <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       <b>exit</b>   Causes <b>ovsdb-server</b> to gracefully terminate.

       <b>ovsdb-server/compact</b> [<u>db</u>]
              Compacts database <u>db</u> in-place.  If <u>db</u> is not specified, compacts
              every database in-place.  A database is also compacted automati‐
              cally when a transaction is logged if it  is  over  2  times  as
              large  as  its previous compacted size (and at least 10 MB), but
              not before 100 commits  have  been  added  or  10  minutes  have
              elapsed since the last compaction. It will also be compacted au‐
              tomatically after 24 hours since the last compaction if 100 com‐
              mits were added regardless of its size.

       <b>ovsdb-server/memory-trim-on-compaction</b> <u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              If  this  option is <u>on</u>, ovsdb-server will try to reclaim all un‐
              used heap memory back to the system after each successful  data‐
              base compaction to reduce the memory consumption of the process.
              <u>off</u> by default.

       <b>ovsdb-server/reconnect</b>
              Makes <b>ovsdb-server</b> drop all of the JSON-RPC connections to data‐
              base clients and reconnect.

              This  command might be useful for debugging issues with database
              clients.

       <b>ovsdb-server/add-remote</b> <u>remote</u>
              Adds a remote, as if <b>--remote=</b><u>remote</u> had been specified  on  the
              <b>ovsdb-server</b> command line.  (If <u>remote</u> is already a remote, this
              command succeeds without changing the configuration.)

              Mutually exclusive with the <b>--config-file</b> option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/remove-remote</b> <u>remote</u>
              Removes  the  specified  <u>remote</u>  from the configuration, failing
              with an error if <u>remote</u> is not configured  as  a  remote.   This
              command  only  works with remotes that were named on <b>--remote</b> or
              <b>ovsdb-server/add-remote</b>, that is, it  will  not  remove  remotes
              added  indirectly  because  they  were read from the database by
              configuring a <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u>  remote.   (You  can  remove  a
              database source with <b>ovsdb-server/remove-remote</b> <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>col‐</u>
              <u>umn</u>,  but  not  individual  remotes found indirectly through the
              database.)

              Mutually exclusive with the <b>--config-file</b> option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/list-remotes</b>
              Outputs a list of the  currently  configured  remotes  named  on
              <b>--remote</b>  or  <b>ovsdb-server/add-remote</b>, that is, it does not list
              remotes added indirectly because they were read from  the  data‐
              base by configuring a <b>db:</b><u>db</u><b>,</b><u>table</u><b>,</b><u>column</u> remote.

       <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b> <u>database</u>
              Adds  the  <u>database</u> to the running <b>ovsdb-server</b>.  <u>database</u> could
              be a database file or a relay description in the following  for‐
              mat:  <u>relay:schema</u><b>_</b><u>name:remote</u>.   The database file must already
              have been created and initialized using, for example, <b>ovsdb-tool</b>
              <b>create</b>.

              Mutually exclusive with the <b>--config-file</b> option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/remove-db</b> <u>database</u>
              Removes <u>database</u> from the running <b>ovsdb-server</b>.   <u>database</u>  must
              be a database name as listed by <b>ovsdb-server/list-dbs</b>.

              If  a  remote  has  been configured that points to the specified
              <u>database</u> (e.g. <b>--remote=db:</b><u>database</u><b>,</b>... on  the  command  line),
              then  it  will  be disabled until another database with the same
              name is added again (with <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b>).

              Any public key infrastructure  options  specified  through  this
              database  (e.g.  <b>--private-key=db:</b><u>database,</u>...  on  the  command
              line) will be disabled until another database with the same name
              is added again (with <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b>).

              Mutually exclusive with the <b>--config-file</b> option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/list-dbs</b>
              Outputs a list of the currently configured databases  added  ei‐
              ther through the command line or through the <b>ovsdb-server/add-db</b>
              command.

       <b>ovsdb-server/tlog-set</b> <u>database</u>:<u>table</u> <u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              Enables  or  disables  logging of all operations executed on the
              specified database and table.  Logs are generated at INFO  level
              and are rate limtied.

       <b>ovsdb-server/tlog-list</b>
              Displays  the  logging  state for all currently configured data‐
              bases and tables.

   <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and update the role of <b>ovsdb-server</b> within an  ac‐
       tive-backup pair of servers.  See <b>Active-Backup</b> <b>Options</b>, above, and <b>Ac‐</b>
       <b>tive-Backup</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Model</b> in <b>ovsdb</b>(7) for more information.

       All  <b>Active-Backup</b>  <b>Commands</b>  that change the state of <b>ovsdb-server</b> are
       mutually exclusive with the <b>--config-file</b> option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/set-active-ovsdb-server</b> <u>server</u>
              Sets  the active <u>server</u> from which <b>ovsdb-server</b> connects through
              <b>ovsdb-server/connect-active-ovsdb-server</b>.   This  overrides  the
              <b>--sync-from</b> command-line option.

       <b>ovsdb-server/get-active-ovsdb-server</b>
              Gets the active server from which <b>ovsdb-server</b> is currently syn‐
              chronizing its databases.

       <b>ovsdb-server/connect-active-ovsdb-server</b>
              Switches  the  server  to a backup role.  The server starts syn‐
              chronizing its databases with the  active  server  specified  by
              <b>ovsdb-server/set-active-ovsdb-server</b>  (or  the  <b>--sync-from</b> com‐
              mand-line option) and closes all  existing  client  connections,
              which requires clients to reconnect.

       <b>ovsdb-server/disconnect-active-ovsdb-server</b>
              Switches  the  server  to an active role.  The server stops syn‐
              chronizing its databases with an active server  and  closes  all
              existing  client  connections,  which requires clients to recon‐
              nect.

       <b>ovsdb-server/set-active-ovsdb-server-probe-interval</b> <u>probe</u> <u>interval</u>
              Sets  the probe interval (in milli seconds) for  the  connection
              to active <u>server</u>.

       <b>ovsdb-server/set-sync-exclude-tables</b> <u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>[<b>,</b><u>db</u><b>:</b><u>table</u>]...
              Sets the <u>table</u> within <u>db</u> that will be excluded from synchroniza‐
              tion.  This overrides the <b>--sync-exclude-tables</b> command-line op‐
              tion.

       <b>ovsdb-server/get-sync-exclude-tables</b>
              Gets  the  tables  that are currently excluded from synchroniza‐
              tion.

       <b>ovsdb-server/sync-status</b>
              Prints  a summary of replication run time information. The <b>state</b>
              information is always provided, indicating whether the server is
              running in the <u>active</u> or the <u>backup</u>  mode.   For  all  databases
              with active-backup service model, replication connection status,
              which can be either <u>connecting</u>, <u>replicating</u> or <u>error</u>, are shown.
              When  the  connection  is  in  <u>replicating</u> state, further output
              shows the tables that are currently excluded from replication.

   <b>Cluster</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands support the <b>ovsdb-server</b> clustered service model.   They
       apply  only  to  databases  in the format used for clustered databases,
       which is the database format created by <b>ovsdb-tool</b>  <b>create-cluster</b>  and
       <b>ovsdb-tool</b> <b>join-cluster</b>.

       <b>cluster/cid</b> <u>db</u>
              Prints  the  cluster  ID for <u>db</u>, which is a UUID that identifies
              the cluster.  If <u>db</u> is a database newly  created  by  <b>ovsdb-tool</b>
              <b>cluster-join</b>  that  has not yet successfully joined its cluster,
              and <b>--cid</b> was not specified on the  <b>cluster-join</b>  command  line,
              then this command will report an error because the cluster ID is
              not yet known.

       <b>cluster/sid</b> <u>db</u>
              Prints  the  server  ID  for <u>db</u>, which is a UUID that identifies
              this server within the cluster.

       <b>cluster/status</b> <u>db</u>
              Prints this server's status within the cluster and the status of
              its connections to other servers in the cluster.

       <b>cluster/leave</b> <u>db</u>
              This command starts the server gracefully removing  itself  from
              its  cluster.   At least one server must remain, and the cluster
              must be healthy, that is, over half  of  the  cluster's  servers
              must be up.

              When  the server successfully leaves the cluster, it stops serv‐
              ing <u>db</u>, as if <b>ovsdb-server/remove-db</b> <u>db</u> had been executed.

              Use <b>ovsdb-client</b> <b>wait</b> (see <b>ovsdb-client</b>(1)) to  wait  until  the
              server has left the cluster.

              Once  a  server  leaves  a cluster, it may never rejoin it.  In‐
              stead, create a new server and join it to the cluster.

              Note that removing the server from the cluster alters the  total
              size of the cluster. For example, if you remove two servers from
              a  three  server  cluster,  then  the "cluster" becomes a single
              functioning server.  This does not  result  in  a  three  server
              cluster that lacks quorum.

       <b>cluster/kick</b> <u>db</u> <u>server</u>
              Start  graceful  removal of <u>server</u> from <u>db</u>'s cluster, like <b>clus‐</b>
              <b>ter/leave</b>, except that it can remove any server, not  just  this
              one.

              <u>server</u>  may  be  a  server ID, as printed by <b>cluster/sid</b>, or the
              server's local network address as passed  to  <b>ovsdb-tool</b>'s  <b>cre‐</b>
              <b>ate-cluster</b>  or <b>join-cluster</b> command.  Use <b>cluster/status</b> to see
              a list of cluster members.

       <b>cluster/change-election-timer</b> <u>db</u> <u>time</u>
              Change the leader election timeout base value of the cluster, in
              milliseconds.

              Leader election will be initiated by a follower if there  is  no
              heartbeat  received from the leader within this time plus a ran‐
              dom time within 1 second.

              The default value is 1000, if not  changed  with  this  command.
              This command can be used to adjust the value when necessary, ac‐
              cording to the expected load and response time of the servers.

              This  command  must be executed on the leader.  It initiates the
              change to the cluster.  To see if the change takes effect  (com‐
              mitted), use <b>cluster/status</b> to show the current setting.  Once a
              change is committed, it persists at server restarts.

       <b>cluster/set-backlog-threshold</b> <u>db</u> <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>msgs</u> <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>bytes</u>
              Sets  the  backlog limits for <u>db</u>'s RAFT connections to a maximum
              of <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>msgs</u> messages or <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>bytes</u> bytes.  If the backlog on  one  of
              the  connections reaches the limit, it will be disconnected (and
              re-established).  Values are checked only if  the  backlog  con‐
              tains more than 50 messages.

   <b>VLOG</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s logging settings.

       <b>vlog/set</b> [<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will  not  take  place  unless <b>ovsdb-server</b> was invoked with the
              <b>--log-file</b> option.

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>vlog/set</b> <b>PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>vlog/list</b>
              Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.

       <b>vlog/list-pattern</b>
              Lists logging patterns used for each destination.

       <b>vlog/close</b>
              Causes  <b>ovsdb-server</b> to close its log file, if it is open.  (Use
              <b>vlog/reopen</b> to reopen it later.)

       <b>vlog/reopen</b>
              Causes <b>ovsdb-server</b> to close its log file, if it  is  open,  and
              then  reopen  it.   (This is useful after rotating log files, to
              cause a new log file to be used.)

              This has no effect unless  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  was  invoked  with  the
              <b>--log-file</b> option.

       <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b> [<u>module</u>]...
       <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit</b> [<u>module</u>]...
              By  default,  <b>ovsdb-server</b> limits the rate at which certain mes‐
              sages can be logged.  When a  message  would  appear  more  fre‐
              quently  than  the  limit,  it  is  suppressed.  This saves disk
              space, makes logs easier to read, and speeds up  execution,  but
              occasionally  troubleshooting  requires more detail.  Therefore,
              <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b> allows rate limits to be disabled at the
              level of an individual log module.  Specify one or  more  module
              names, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command.  Specifying either
              no  module  names at all or the keyword <b>any</b> disables rate limits
              for every log module.

              The <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit</b> command, whose syntax is the same  as
              <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b>,  can  be used to re-enable a rate limit
              that was previously disabled.

   <b>MEMORY</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands report memory usage.

       <b>memory/show</b>
              Displays some basic statistics about <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s  memory  us‐
              age.  <b>ovsdb-server</b> also logs this information soon after startup
              and periodically as its memory consumption grows.

   <b>COVERAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovsdb-server</b>'s ``coverage counters,'' which count
       the  number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
       In addition to these commands, <b>ovsdb-server</b> automatically logs coverage
       counter values, at <b>INFO</b> level, when it detects that the  daemon's  main
       loop takes unusually long to run.

       Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and debug‐
       ging.

       <b>coverage/show</b>
              Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds,
              the  last  minute and the last hour, and the total counts of all
              of the coverage counters.

       <b>coverage/read-counter</b> <u>counter</u>
              Displays the total count for the given coverage <u>counter</u>.

<b>BUGS</b>
       In Open vSwitch before version 2.4, when <b>ovsdb-server</b> sent JSON-RPC er‐
       ror responses to some requests, it incorrectly formulated them with the
       <b>result</b> and <b>error</b> swapped, so that the  response  appeared  to  indicate
       success (with a nonsensical result) rather than an error.  The requests
       that suffered from this problem were:

       <b>transact</b>
       <b>get_schema</b>
              Only if the request names a nonexistent database.

       <b>monitor</b>
       <b>lock</b>
       <b>unlock</b> In all error cases.

       Of  these  cases,  the  only  error  that a well-written application is
       likely to encounter in practice is <b>monitor</b> of tables or columns that do
       not exist, in an situation where the application has been upgraded  but
       the  old  database  schema is still temporarily in use.  To handle this
       situation gracefully, we recommend that clients should treat a  <b>monitor</b>
       response  with a <b>result</b> that contains an <b>error</b> key-value pair as an er‐
       ror (assuming that the database being monitored does not contain a  ta‐
       ble named <b>error</b>).
