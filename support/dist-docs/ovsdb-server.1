.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovsdb\-server\fR program provides RPC interfaces to one or more
Open vSwitch databases (OVSDBs).  It supports JSON-RPC client
connections over active or passive TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets.
For an introduction to OVSDB and its implementation in Open vSwitch,
see \fBovsdb\fR(7).
.PP
Each OVSDB file may be specified on the command line as \fIdatabase\fR.
Relay databases may be specified on the command line as
\fIrelay:schema_name:remote\fR.  For a detailed description of relay database
argument, see \fBovsdb\fR(7).
If none of database files or relay databases is specified, the default is
\fB/usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db\fR.  The database files must already have been created and
initialized using, for example, \fBovsdb\-tool\fR's \fBcreate\fR,
\fBcreate\-cluster\fR, or \fBjoin\-cluster\fR command.
.PP
This OVSDB implementation supports standalone, active-backup, relay and
clustered database service models, as well as database replication.
See the Service Models section of \fBovsdb\fR(7) for more information.
.PP
For clustered databases, when the \fB\-\-detach\fR option is used,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR detaches without waiting for the server to
successfully join a cluster (if the database file is freshly created
with \fBovsdb\-tool join\-cluster\fR) or connect to a cluster that it
has already joined.  Use \fBovsdb\-client wait\fR (see
\fBovsdb\-client\fR(1)) to wait until the server has successfully
joined and connected to a cluster.  The same is true for relay databases.
Same commands could be used to wait for a relay database to connect to
the relay source (remote).
.PP
In addition to user-specified databases, \fBovsdb\-server\fR version
2.9 and later also always hosts a built-in database named
\fB_Server\fR.  Please see \fBovsdb\-server\fR(5) for documentation on
this database's schema.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB\-\-remote=\fIremote\fR"
Adds \fIremote\fR as a connection method used by \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
The \fIremote\fR may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method,
e.g. \fBpssl:6640\fR, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).  The following
additional form is also supported:
.
.RS
.IP "\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR"
Reads additional connection methods from \fIcolumn\fR in all of the
rows in \fItable\fR within \fIdb\fR.  As the contents of \fIcolumn\fR changes,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR also adds and drops connection methods accordingly.
.IP
If \fIcolumn\fR's type is string or set of strings, then the
connection methods are taken directly from the column.  The connection
methods in the column must have one of the forms described above.
.IP
If \fIcolumn\fR's type is UUID or set of UUIDs and references a table,
then each UUID is looked up in the referenced table to obtain a row.
The following columns in the row, if present and of the correct type,
configure a connection method.  Any additional columns are ignored.
.RS
.IP "\fBtarget\fR (string)"
Connection method, in one of the forms described above.  This column
is mandatory: if it is missing or empty then no connection method can
be configured.
.IP "\fBmax_backoff\fR (integer)"
Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection attempts.
.IP "\fBinactivity_probe\fR (integer)"
Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to
client before sending an inactivity probe message.
.IP "\fBread_only\fR (boolean)"
If true, only read-only transactions are allowed on this connection.
.RE
.IP
It is an error for \fIcolumn\fR to have another type.
.RE
.
.IP
To connect or listen on multiple connection methods, use multiple
\fB\-\-remote\fR options.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-run=\fIcommand\fR]"
Ordinarily \fBovsdb\-server\fR runs forever, or until it is told to
exit (see \fBRUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\fR below).  With this option,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR instead starts a shell subprocess running
\fIcommand\fR.  When the subprocess terminates, \fBovsdb\-server\fR
also exits gracefully.  If the subprocess exits normally with exit
code 0, then \fBovsdb\-server\fR exits with exit code 0 also;
otherwise, it exits with exit code 1.
.IP
This option can be useful where a database server is needed only to
run a single command, e.g.:
.B "ovsdb\-server \-\-remote=punix:socket \-\-run='ovsdb\-client dump unix:socket Open_vSwitch'"
.IP
This option is not supported on Windows platform.
.SS "Daemon Options"
.ds DD \
\fBovsdb\-server\fR detaches only after it starts listening on all \
configured remotes.  At this point, all standalone and active-backup \
databases are ready for use.  Clustered databases only become ready \
for use after they finish joining their clusters (which could have \
already happened in previous runs of \fBovsdb\-server\fR).
.PP
The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR[\fB=\fIpidfile\fR]
Causes a file (by default, \fB\*(PN.pid\fR) to be created indicating
the PID of the running process.  If the \fIpidfile\fR argument is not
specified, or
if it does not begin with \fB/\fR, then it is created in
\fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR.
.IP
If \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, no pidfile is created.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is specified and the specified pidfile 
already exists and is locked by a running process, \fB\*(PN\fR refuses 
to start.  Specify \fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR to cause it to instead 
overwrite the pidfile.
.IP
When \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, this option has no effect.
.
.IP \fB\-\-detach\fR
Runs \fB\*(PN\fR as a background process.  The process forks, and in
the child it starts a new session, closes the standard file
descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging to the
console), and changes its current directory to the root (unless
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR is specified).  After the child completes its
initialization, the parent exits.  \*(DD
.
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\fR
Creates an additional process to monitor the \fB\*(PN\fR daemon.  If
the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error
(\fBSIGABRT\fR, \fBSIGALRM\fR, \fBSIGBUS\fR, \fBSIGFPE\fR,
\fBSIGILL\fR, \fBSIGPIPE\fR, \fBSIGSEGV\fR, \fBSIGXCPU\fR, or
\fBSIGXFSZ\fR) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it.  If
the daemon dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process exits.
.IP
This option is normally used with \fB\-\-detach\fR, but it also
functions without it.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR 
changes its current working directory to the root directory after it 
detaches.  Otherwise, invoking \fB\*(PN\fR from a carelessly chosen 
directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting the file 
system that holds that directory.
.IP
Specifying \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR suppresses this behavior, preventing
\fB\*(PN\fR from changing its current working directory.  This may be 
useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to write 
core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory 
is not a good directory to use.
.IP
This option has no effect when \fB\-\-detach\fR is not specified.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-self\-confinement\fR
By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with
files under well-known directories determined during build.  It
is better to stick with this default behavior and not to use this
flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon.
Note that in contrast to other access control implementations that
are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC),
self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon itself and
hence should not be considered as a full confinement strategy, but
instead should be viewed as an additional layer of security.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-user\fR
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to run as a different user specified in "user:group", thus
dropping most of the root privileges. Short forms "user" and ":group" are also
allowed, with current user or group are assumed respectively. Only daemons
started by the root user accepts this argument.
.IP
On Linux, daemons will be granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES
before dropping root privileges. Daemons that interact with a datapath,
such as \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR, will be granted three additional capabilities,
namely CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_NET_BROADCAST and CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability
change will apply even if the new user is root.
.IP
On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security reasons,
specifying this option will cause the daemon process not to start.
.SS "Service Options"
The following options are valid only on Windows platform.
.TP
\fB\-\-service\fR
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to run as a service in the background. The service
should already have been created through external tools like \fBSC.exe\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-service\-monitor\fR
Causes the \fB\*(PN\fR service to be automatically restarted by the Windows
services manager if the service dies or exits for unexpected reasons.
.IP
When \fB\-\-service\fR is not specified, this option has no effect.
.SS "Logging Options"
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.  (If \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR closes
its standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
effect.)
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIdestination\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vFACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=FACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. \fIfacility\fR can be one of
\fBkern\fR, \fBuser\fR, \fBmail\fR, \fBdaemon\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBsyslog\fR,
\fBlpr\fR, \fBnews\fR, \fBuucp\fR, \fBclock\fR, \fBftp\fR, \fBntp\fR,
\fBaudit\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBclock2\fR, \fBlocal0\fR, \fBlocal1\fR,
\fBlocal2\fR, \fBlocal3\fR, \fBlocal4\fR, \fBlocal5\fR, \fBlocal6\fR or
\fBlocal7\fR. If this option is not specified, \fBdaemon\fR is used as
the default for the local system syslog and \fBlocal0\fR is used while sending
a message to the target provided via the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-method=\fImethod\fR"
Specify \fImethod\fR how syslog messages should be sent to syslog daemon.
Following forms are supported:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBlibc\fR, use libc \fBsyslog()\fR function.
Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over \fB/dev/log\fR
UNIX domain socket.
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fR\fR, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possible to
specify arbitrary message format with this option.  However,
\fBrsyslogd 8.9\fR and older versions use hard coded parser function anyway
that limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use arbitrary message
format with older \fBrsyslogd\fR versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
IP address instead.
.IP \(bu
\fBudp:\fIip\fR:\fIport\fR\fR, use UDP socket.  With this method it is
possible to use arbitrary message format also with older \fBrsyslogd\fR.
When sending syslog messages over UDP socket extra precaution needs to
be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be
interfering with local syslog traffic and there are some security
considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain
sockets.
.IP \(bu
\fBnull\fR, discards all messages logged to syslog.
.RE
.IP
The default is taken from the \fBOVS_SYSLOG_METHOD\fR environment
variable; if it is unset, the default is \fBlibc\fR.
.SS "Active-Backup Options"
These options support the \fBovsdb\-server\fR active-backup service
model and database replication.  These options apply only to databases
in the format used for standalone and active-backup databases, which
is the database format created by \fBovsdb\-tool create\fR.  By
default, when it serves a database in this format, \fBovsdb\-server\fR
runs as a standalone server.  These options can configure it for
active-backup use:
.IP \(bu
Use \fB\-\-sync\-from=\fIserver\fR to start the server in the backup
role, replicating data from \fIserver\fR.  When \fBovsdb\-server\fR is
running as a backup server, it rejects all transactions that can
modify the database content, including lock commands.  The same form
can be used to configure the local database as a replica of
\fIserver\fR.
.IP \(bu
Use \fB\-\-sync\-from=\fIserver\fB \-\-active\fR to start the server
in the active role, but prepared to switch to the backup role in which
it would replicate data from \fIserver\fR.  When \fBovsdb\-server\fR
runs in active mode, it allows all transactions, including those that
modify the database.
.PP
At runtime, management commands can change a server's role and otherwise
manage active-backup features.  See \fBActive-Backup Commands\fR, below,
for more information.
.TP
\fB\-\-sync\-from=\fIserver\fR
Sets up \fBovsdb\-server\fR to synchronize its databases with the
databases in \fIserver\fR, which must be an active connection method
in one of the forms documented in \fBovsdb\-client\fR(1).  Every
transaction committed by \fIserver\fR will be replicated to
\fBovsdb\-server\fR.  This option makes \fBovsdb\-server\fR start
as a backup server; add \fB\-\-active\fR to make it start as an
active server.
.TP
\fB\-\-sync\-exclude-tables=\fIdb\fB:\fItable\fR[\fB,\fIdb\fB:\fItable\fR]...\fR
Causes the specified tables to be excluded from replication.
.TP
\fB\-\-active\fR
By default, \fB\-\-sync\-from\fR makes \fBovsdb\-server\fR start up as
a backup for \fIserver\fR.  With \fB\-\-active\fR, however,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR starts as an active server.  Use this option to
allow the syncing options to be specified using command line options,
yet start the server, as the default, active server.  To switch the
running server to backup mode, use \fBovs-appctl(1)\fR to execute the
\fBovsdb\-server/connect\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR command.
.SS "Public Key Infrastructure Options"
The options described below for configuring the SSL public key
infrastructure accept a special syntax for obtaining their
configuration from the database.  If any of these options is given
\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR as its argument, then the
actual file name is read from the specified \fIcolumn\fR in \fItable\fR
within the \fIdb\fR database.  The \fIcolumn\fR must have type
string or set of strings.  The first nonempty string in the table is taken
as the file name.  (This means that ordinarily there should be at most
one row in \fItable\fR.)
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIprivkey.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-private\-key=\fIprivkey.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as \fB\*(PN\fR's
identity for outgoing SSL connections.
.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIcert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-certificate=\fIcert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
private key specified on \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-private\-key\fR to be
trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the certificate
authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.
.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIcacert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that \fB\*(PN\fR
should use to verify certificates presented to it by SSL peers.  (This
may be the same certificate that SSL peers use to verify the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may
be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
.
.IP "\fB\-C none\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=none\fR"
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL peers.  This
introduces a security risk, because it means that certificates cannot
be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
When \fIcacert.pem\fR exists, this option has the same effect as
\fB\-C\fR or \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.  If it does not exist, then
\fB\*(PN\fR will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the
SSL peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM
file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection
and reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be
authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus
obtained.
.IP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.IP
This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as
part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol does not require
the server to send the CA certificate.
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-C\fR and
\fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-peer\-ca\-cert=\fIpeer-cacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional certificates
to send to SSL peers.  \fIpeer-cacert.pem\fR should be the CA
certificate used to sign \fB\*(PN\fR's own certificate, that is, the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR.  If
\fB\*(PN\fR's certificate is self-signed, then \fB\-\-certificate\fR
and \fB\-\-peer\-ca\-cert\fR should specify the same file.
.IP
This option is not useful in normal operation, because the SSL peer
must already have the CA certificate for the peer to have any
confidence in \fB\*(PN\fR's identity.  However, this offers a way for
a new installation to bootstrap the CA certificate on its first SSL
connection.
.SS "SSL Connection Options"
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\-protocols=\fIprotocols\fR"
Specifies, in a comma- or space-delimited list, the SSL protocols
\fB\*(PN\fR will enable for SSL connections.  Supported
\fIprotocols\fR include \fBTLSv1\fR, \fBTLSv1.1\fR, and \fBTLSv1.2\fR.
Regardless of order, the highest protocol supported by both sides will
be chosen when making the connection.  The default when this option is
omitted is \fBTLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-ssl\-ciphers=\fIciphers\fR"
Specifies, in OpenSSL cipher string format, the ciphers \fB\*(PN\fR will 
support for SSL connections.  The default when this option is omitted is
\fBHIGH:!aNULL:!MD5\fR.
.SS "Other Options"
.IP "\fB\-\-unixctl=\fIsocket\fR"
Sets the name of the control socket on which \fB\*(PN\fR listens for
runtime management commands (see \fBRUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\fR,
below).  If \fIsocket\fR does not begin with \fB/\fR, it is
interpreted as relative to \fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR.  If \fB\-\-unixctl\fR is
not used at all, the default socket is
\fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/\*(PN.\fIpid\fB.ctl\fR, where \fIpid\fR is \fB\*(PN\fR's
process ID.
.IP
On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime management
commands.  A file is created in the absolute path as pointed by
\fIsocket\fR or if \fB\-\-unixctl\fR is not used at all, a file is
created as \fB\*(PN.ctl\fR in the configured \fIOVS_RUNDIR\fR
directory.  The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.
.IP
Specifying \fBnone\fR for \fIsocket\fR disables the control socket
feature.
.IP "\fB\-\-record[=\fIdirectory\fR]"
Sets the process in "recording" mode, in which it will record all the
connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network sockets) and some other
important necessary bits, so they could be replayed later.
Recorded data is stored in replay files in specified \fIdirectory\fR.
If \fIdirectory\fR does not begin with \fB/\fR, it is interpreted as relative
to \fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR.  If \fIdirectory\fR is not specified, \fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR will
be used.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-replay[=\fIdirectory\fR]"
Sets the process in "replay" mode, in which it will read information about
connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network sockets) and some
other necessary bits directly from replay files instead of using real sockets.
Replay files from the \fIdirectory\fR will be used.  If \fIdirectory\fR does
not begin with \fB/\fR, it is interpreted as relative to \fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR.
If \fIdirectory\fR is not specified, \fB/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch\fR will be used.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-help\fR"
Prints a brief help message to the console.
.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-version\fR"
Prints version information to the console.
.SH "RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS"
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) can send commands to a running
\fBovsdb\-server\fR process.  The currently supported commands are
described below.
.SS "\fBovsdb\-server\fR Commands"
These commands are specific to \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
.IP "\fBexit\fR"
Causes \fBovsdb\-server\fR to gracefully terminate.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/compact\fR [\fIdb\fR]"
Compacts database \fIdb\fR in-place.  If \fIdb\fR is not
specified, compacts every database in-place.  A database is also
compacted automatically when a transaction is logged if it is over 2
times as large as its previous compacted size (and at least 10 MB),
but not before 100 commits have been added or 10 minutes have elapsed
since the last compaction. It will also be compacted automatically
after 24 hours since the last compaction if 100 commits were added
regardless of its size.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/memory-trim-on-compaction\fR \fIon\fR|\fIoff\fR"
If this option is \fIon\fR, ovsdb-server will try to reclaim all unused
heap memory back to the system after each successful database compaction
to reduce the memory consumption of the process.  \fIoff\fR by default.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/reconnect\fR"
Makes \fBovsdb\-server\fR drop all of the JSON\-RPC
connections to database clients and reconnect.
.IP
This command might be useful for debugging issues with database
clients.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/add\-remote \fIremote\fR"
Adds a remote, as if \fB\-\-remote=\fIremote\fR had been specified on
the \fBovsdb\-server\fR command line.  (If \fIremote\fR is already a
remote, this command succeeds without changing the configuration.)
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/remove\-remote \fIremote\fR"
Removes the specified \fIremote\fR from the configuration, failing
with an error if \fIremote\fR is not configured as a remote.  This
command only works with remotes that were named on \fB\-\-remote\fR or
\fBovsdb\-server/add\-remote\fR, that is, it will not remove remotes
added indirectly because they were read from the database by
configuring a \fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR remote.
(You can remove a database source with \fBovsdb\-server/remove\-remote
\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR, but not individual
remotes found indirectly through the database.)
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/list\-remotes"
Outputs a list of the currently configured remotes named on
\fB\-\-remote\fR or \fBovsdb\-server/add\-remote\fR, that is, it does
not list remotes added indirectly because they were read from the
database by configuring a
\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR remote.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/add\-db \fIdatabase\fR
Adds the \fIdatabase\fR to the running \fBovsdb\-server\fR.  \fIdatabase\fR
could be a database file or a relay description in the following format:
\fIrelay:schema_name:remote\fR.  The database file must already have been
created and initialized using, for example, \fBovsdb\-tool create\fR.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/remove\-db \fIdatabase\fR"
Removes \fIdatabase\fR from the running \fBovsdb\-server\fR.  \fIdatabase\fR
must be a database name as listed by \fBovsdb-server/list\-dbs\fR.
.IP
If a remote has been configured that points to the specified
\fIdatabase\fR (e.g. \fB\-\-remote=db:\fIdatabase\fB,\fR... on the
command line), then it will be disabled until another database with
the same name is added again (with \fBovsdb\-server/add\-db\fR).
.IP
Any public key infrastructure options specified through this database
(e.g. \fB\-\-private\-key=db:\fIdatabase,\fR... on the command line)
will be disabled until another database with the same name is added
again (with \fBovsdb\-server/add\-db\fR).
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/list\-dbs"
Outputs a list of the currently configured databases added either through
the command line or through the \fBovsdb\-server/add\-db\fR command.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/tlog\-set \fIdatabase\fR:\fItable\fR \fIon\fR|\fIoff\fR"
Enables or disables logging of all operations executed on the specified
database and table.  Logs are generated at INFO level and are rate limtied.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/tlog\-list"
Displays the logging state for all currently configured databases and tables.
.
.SS "Active-Backup Commands"
.PP
These commands query and update the role of \fBovsdb\-server\fR within
an active-backup pair of servers.  See \fBActive-Backup Options\fR,
above, and \fBActive-Backup Database Service Model\fR in
\fBovsdb\fR(7) for more information.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/set\-active\-ovsdb\-server \fIserver"
Sets  the active \fIserver\fR from which \fBovsdb\-server\fR connects through
\fBovsdb\-server/connect\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR.
This overrides the \fB\-\-sync\-from\fR command-line option.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/get\-active\-ovsdb\-server"
Gets the active server from which \fBovsdb\-server\fR is currently synchronizing
its databases.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/connect\-active\-ovsdb\-server"
Switches the server to a backup role.  The server starts synchronizing
its databases with the active server specified by
\fBovsdb\-server/set\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR (or the
\fB\-\-sync\-from\fR command-line option) and closes all existing
client connections, which requires clients to reconnect.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/disconnect\-active\-ovsdb\-server"
Switches the server to an active role.  The server stops synchronizing
its databases with an active server and closes all existing client
connections, which requires clients to reconnect.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/set\-active\-ovsdb\-server\-probe\-interval \fIprobe interval"
Sets  the probe interval (in milli seconds) for the connection to
active \fIserver\fR.
.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/set\-sync\-exclude\-tables \fIdb\fB:\fItable\fR[\fB,\fIdb\fB:\fItable\fR]..."
Sets the \fItable\fR within \fIdb\fR that will be excluded from synchronization.
This overrides the \fB\-\-sync\-exclude-tables\fR command-line option.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/get\-sync\-exclude\-tables"
Gets  the  tables  that are currently excluded from synchronization.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/sync\-status"
Prints a summary of replication run time information. The \fBstate\fR
information is always provided, indicating whether the server is running
in the \fIactive\fR or the \fIbackup\fR mode.
When running in backup mode, replication connection status, which
can be either \fIconnecting\fR, \fIreplicating\fR or \fIerror\fR, are shown.
When the connection is in \fIreplicating\fR state, further output shows
the list of databases currently replicating, and the tables that are
excluded.
.
.SS "Cluster Commands"
These commands support the \fBovsdb\-server\fR clustered service model.
They apply only to databases in the format used for clustered databases,
which is the database format created by \fBovsdb\-tool create\-cluster\fR
and \fBovsdb\-tool join\-cluster\fR.
.
.IP "\fBcluster/cid \fIdb\fR"
Prints the cluster ID for \fIdb\fR, which is a UUID that identifies
the cluster.  If \fIdb\fR is a database newly created by
\fBovsdb\-tool cluster\-join\fR that has not yet successfully joined
its cluster, and \fB\-\-cid\fR was not specified on the
\fBcluster\-join\fR command line, then this command will report an
error because the cluster ID is not yet known.
.
.IP "\fBcluster/sid \fIdb\fR"
Prints the server ID for \fIdb\fR, which is a UUID that identifies
this server within the cluster.
.
.IP "\fBcluster/status \fIdb\fR"
Prints this server's status within the cluster and the status of its
connections to other servers in the cluster.
.
.IP "\fBcluster/leave \fIdb\fR"
This command starts the server gracefully
removing itself from its cluster.  At least one server must remain,
and the cluster must be healthy, that is, over half of the cluster's
servers must be up.
.IP
When the server successfully leaves the cluster, it stops serving
\fIdb\fR, as if \fBovsdb\-server/remove\-db \fIdb\fR had been
executed.
.IP
Use \fBovsdb\-client wait\fR (see \fBovsdb\-client\fR(1)) to wait
until the server has left the cluster.
.IP
Once a server leaves a cluster, it may never rejoin it.  Instead,
create a new server and join it to the cluster.
.IP
Note that removing the server from the cluster alters the total size
of the cluster. For example, if you remove two servers from a three
server cluster, then the "cluster" becomes a single functioning server.
This does not result in a three server cluster that lacks quorum.
.
.IP "\fBcluster/kick \fIdb server\fR"
Start graceful removal of \fIserver\fR from \fIdb\fR's cluster, like
\fBcluster/leave\fR (without \fB\-\-force\fR) except that it can
remove any server, not just this one.
.IP
\fIserver\fR may be a server ID, as printed by \fBcluster/sid\fR, or
the server's local network address as passed to \fBovsdb-tool\fR's
\fBcreate\-cluster\fR or \fBjoin\-cluster\fR command.  Use
\fBcluster/status\fR to see a list of cluster members.
.
.IP "\fBcluster/change-election-timer \fIdb time\fR"
Change the leader election timeout base value of the cluster, in milliseconds.
.IP
Leader election will be initiated by a follower if there is no heartbeat
received from the leader within this time plus a random time within 1 second.
.IP
The default value is 1000, if not changed with this command.  This command can
be used to adjust the value when necessary, according to the expected load and
response time of the servers.
.IP
This command must be executed on the leader.  It initiates the change to the
cluster.  To see if the change takes effect (committed), use
\fBcluster/status\fR to show the current setting.  Once a change is committed,
it persists at server restarts.
.IP "\fBcluster/set\-backlog\-threshold \fIdb\fR \fIn_msgs\fR \fIn_bytes\fR"
Sets the backlog limits for \fIdb\fR's RAFT connections to a maximum of
\fIn_msgs\fR messages or \fIn_bytes\fR bytes.  If the backlog on one of the
connections reaches the limit, it will be disconnected (and re-established).
Values are checked only if the backlog contains more than 50 messages.
.
.SS "VLOG COMMANDS"
These commands manage \fB\*(PN\fR's logging settings.
.IP "\fBvlog/set\fR [\fIspec\fR]"
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu 
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\*(PN\fR was invoked with the
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR option.
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.RE
.IP "\fBvlog/set PATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIdestination\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/list\fR"
Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/list-pattern\fR"
Lists logging patterns used for each destination.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/close\fR"
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to close its log file, if it is open.  (Use
\fBvlog/reopen\fR to reopen it later.)
.
.IP "\fBvlog/reopen\fR"
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to close its log file, if it is open, and then
reopen it.  (This is useful after rotating log files, to cause a new
log file to be used.)
.IP
This has no effect unless \fB\*(PN\fR was invoked with the
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR option.
.
.IP "\fBvlog/disable\-rate\-limit \fR[\fImodule\fR]..."
.IQ "\fBvlog/enable\-rate\-limit \fR[\fImodule\fR]..."
By default, \fB\*(PN\fR limits the rate at which certain messages can
be logged.  When a message would appear more frequently than the
limit, it is suppressed.  This saves disk space, makes logs easier to
read, and speeds up execution, but occasionally troubleshooting
requires more detail.  Therefore, \fBvlog/disable\-rate\-limit\fR
allows rate limits to be disabled at the level of an individual log
module.  Specify one or more module names, as displayed by the
\fBvlog/list\fR command.  Specifying either no module names at all or
the keyword \fBany\fR disables rate limits for every log module.
.
.IP
The \fBvlog/enable\-rate\-limit\fR command, whose syntax is the same
as \fBvlog/disable\-rate\-limit\fR, can be used to re-enable a rate
limit that was previously disabled.
.SS "MEMORY COMMANDS"
These commands report memory usage.
.
.IP "\fBmemory/show\fR"
Displays some basic statistics about \fB\*(PN\fR's memory usage.
\fB\*(PN\fR also logs this information soon after startup and
periodically as its memory consumption grows.
.SS "COVERAGE COMMANDS"
These commands manage \fB\*(PN\fR's ``coverage counters,'' which count
the number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
In addition to these commands, \fB\*(PN\fR automatically logs coverage
counter values, at \fBINFO\fR level, when it detects that the daemon's
main loop takes unusually long to run.
.PP
Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and
debugging.
.IP "\fBcoverage/show\fR"
Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds, the
last minute and the last hour, and the total counts of all of the
coverage counters.
.IP "\fBcoverage/read-counter\fR \fIcounter\fR"
Displays the total count for the given coverage \fIcounter\fR.
.SH "BUGS"
.
In Open vSwitch before version 2.4, when \fBovsdb\-server\fR sent
JSON-RPC error responses to some requests, it incorrectly formulated
them with the \fBresult\fR and \fBerror\fR swapped, so that the
response appeared to indicate success (with a nonsensical result)
rather than an error.  The requests that suffered from this problem
were:
.
.IP \fBtransact\fR
.IQ \fBget_schema\fR
Only if the request names a nonexistent database.
.IP \fBmonitor\fR
.IQ \fBlock\fR
.IQ \fBunlock\fR
In all error cases.
.
.PP
Of these cases, the only error that a well-written application is
likely to encounter in practice is \fBmonitor\fR of tables or columns
that do not exist, in an situation where the application has been
upgraded but the old database schema is still temporarily in use.  To
handle this situation gracefully, we recommend that clients should
treat a \fBmonitor\fR response with a \fBresult\fR that contains an
\fBerror\fR key-value pair as an error (assuming that the database
being monitored does not contain a table named \fBerror\fR).
