<u>ovs-dpctl</u>(8)                  Open vSwitch Manual                 <u>ovs-dpctl</u>(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-dpctl - administer Open vSwitch datapaths

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-dpctl</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>switch</u>] [<u>args</u>...]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>ovs-dpctl</b> program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch data‐
       paths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.

       This  program works only with datapaths that are implemented outside of
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> itself, such as the Linux and Windows  kernel-based  data‐
       paths.  To manage datapaths that are integrated into <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, such
       as  the  userspace  (<b>netdev</b>)  datapath, use <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) to invoke the
       <b>dpctl/*</b> commands, which are documented in <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>(8).

       A newly created datapath is associated with only one network device,  a
       virtual  network device sometimes called the datapath's ``local port''.
       A newly created datapath is not, however, associated with  any  of  the
       host's  other  network  devices.  To intercept and process traffic on a
       given network device, use the <b>add-if</b> command  to  explicitly  add  that
       network device to the datapath.

       If <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>(8) is in use, use <b>ovs-vsctl</b>(8) instead of <b>ovs-dpctl</b>.

       Most  <b>ovs-dpctl</b> commands that work with datapaths take an argument that
       specifies the name of the  datapath.   Datapath  names  take  the  form
       [<u>type</u><b>@</b>]<u>name</u>, where <u>name</u> is the network device associated with the data‐
       path's  local  port.   If  <u>type</u>  is  given,  it  specifies the datapath
       provider of <u>name</u>, otherwise the default provider <b>system</b> is assumed.

       The following commands manage datapaths.  Do not use commands to add or
       remove or modify datapaths if <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is running because this  in‐
       terferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own datapath management.

       <b>add-dp</b> <u>dp</u> [<u>netdev</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...]
              Creates datapath <u>dp</u>, with a local port also named <u>dp</u>.  This will
              fail if a network device <u>dp</u> already exists.

              If  <u>netdev</u>s  are specified, <b>ovs-dpctl</b> adds them to the new data‐
              path, just as if <b>add-if</b> was specified.

       <b>del-dp</b> <u>dp</u>
              Deletes datapath <u>dp</u>.  If <u>dp</u> is associated with any  network  de‐
              vices, they are automatically removed.

       <b>add-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>netdev</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...
              Adds each <u>netdev</u> to the set of network devices datapath <u>dp</u> moni‐
              tors,  where  <u>dp</u> is the name of an existing datapath, and <u>netdev</u>
              is the name of one of the host's  network  devices,  e.g.  <b>eth0</b>.
              Once a network device has been added to a datapath, the datapath
              has  complete  ownership of the network device's traffic and the
              network device appears silent to the rest of the system.

              A <u>netdev</u> may be followed by a comma-separated list  of  options.
              The following options are currently supported:

              <b>type=</b><u>type</u>
                     Specifies  the  type of port to add.  The default type is
                     <b>system</b>.

              <b>port_no=</b><u>port</u>
                     Requests a specific port number within the datapath.   If
                     this  option  is not specified then one will be automati‐
                     cally assigned.

              <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
                     Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's configu‐
                     ration.

              <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) documents the available port  types  and
              options.

       <b>set-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>port</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...
              Reconfigures  each  <u>port</u>  in  <u>dp</u> as specified.  An <u>option</u> of the
              form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> adds the specified key-value option to  the  port
              or  overrides  an  existing  key's value.  An <u>option</u> of the form
              <u>key</u><b>=</b>, that is, without a value, deletes the key-value named <u>key</u>.
              The type and port number of a port cannot be  changed,  so  <b>type</b>
              and <b>port_no</b> are only allowed if they match the existing configu‐
              ration.

       <b>del-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>netdev</u>...
              Removes each <u>netdev</u> from the list of network devices datapath <u>dp</u>
              monitors.

       <b>dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.

       [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>show</b> [<u>dp</u>...]
              Prints  a summary of configured datapaths, including their data‐
              path numbers and a list of ports  connected  to  each  datapath.
              (The local port is identified as port 0.)  If <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b>
              is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for
              each port.

              The  datapath  numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow mask
              stats.

              The "lookups" row displays three stats related  to  flow  lookup
              triggered  by processing incoming packets in the datapath. "hit"
              displays number of packets matches existing flows. "missed" dis‐
              plays the number of packets not matching any existing  flow  and
              require  user space processing.  "lost" displays number of pack‐
              ets destined for user space process but subsequently dropped be‐
              fore reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss"  equals  to
              the total number of packets datapath processed.

              The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.

              The  "masks"  row displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is
              omitted for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit"  displays
              the total number of masks visited for matching incoming packets.
              "total" displays number of masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" dis‐
              plays  the average number of masks visited per packet; the ratio
              between "hit" and total number of packets processed by the data‐
              path.

              If one or more datapaths  are  specified,  information  on  only
              those  datapaths  are  displayed.  Otherwise, <b>ovs-dpctl</b> displays
              information about all configured datapaths.

   <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>FLOW</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.
       The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that they  work  with
       are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different and consid‐
       erably  simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module.  Do
       not use  commands  to  add  or  remove  or  modify  datapath  flows  if
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  is  running because it interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own
       datapath flow management.  Use  <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8),  instead,  to  work  with
       OpenFlow flow entries.

       The  <u>dp</u> argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names</b> | <b>--no-names</b>] <b>dump-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>filter=</b><u>filter</u>]
       [<b>type=</b><u>type</u>] [<b>pmd=</b><u>pmd</u>]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow ta‐
              ble.  Without <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, output omits  match  fields  that  a
              flow  wildcards entirely; with <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, output includes all
              wildcarded fields.

              If <b>filter=</b><u>filter</u> is specified,  only  displays  the  flows  that
              match  the  <u>filter</u>. <u>filter</u> is a flow in the form similar to that
              accepted by <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s <b>add-flow</b> command.  (This  is  not  an
              OpenFlow  flow:  besides  other  differences,  it never contains
              wildcards.)  The <u>filter</u>  is  also  useful  to  match  wildcarded
              fields   in   the   datapath   flow.   As   an   example,   <b>fil‐</b>
              <b>ter='tcp,tp_src=100'</b> will match  the  datapath  flow  containing
              '<b>tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)</b>'.

              If  <b>pmd=</b><u>pmd</u>  is  specified, only displays flows of the specified
              pmd.  Using <b>pmd=</b><u>-1</u> will restrict the dump to flows from the main
              thread.  This option is only supported by  the  <b>userspace</b>  <b>data‐</b>
              <b>path</b>.

              If  <b>type=</b><u>type</u> is specified, only displays flows of the specified
              types.    This   option   supported    only    for    <b>ovs-appctl</b>
              <b>dpctl/dump-flows</b>.   <u>type</u>  is  a  comma separated list, which can
              contain any of the following:
                 <b>ovs</b> - displays flows handled in the ovs dp
                 <b>tc</b> - displays flows handled in the tc dp
                 <b>dpdk</b> - displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
                 <b>offloaded</b> - displays flows offloaded to the HW
                 <b>non-offloaded</b> - displays flows not offloaded to the HW
                 <b>partially-offloaded</b> - displays flows where only part of their
              proccessing is done in HW
                 <b>all</b> - displays all the types of flows

              By default all the types of flows are displayed.  <b>ovs-dpctl</b>  al‐
              ways acts as if the <b>type</b> was <u>ovs</u>.

       <b>add-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u> <u>actions</u>

       [<b>--clear</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>mod-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u> <u>actions</u>
              Adds  or  modifies a flow in <u>dp</u>'s flow table that, when a packet
              matching <u>flow</u> arrives, causes <u>actions</u> to be executed.

              The <b>add-flow</b> command succeeds only if <u>flow</u> does not already  ex‐
              ist  in  <u>dp</u>.   Contrariwise,  <b>mod-flow</b> without <b>--may-create</b> only
              modifies the actions for an existing flow.   With  <b>--may-create</b>,
              <b>mod-flow</b> will add a new flow or modify an existing one.

              If  <b>-s</b>  or  <b>--statistics</b>  is specified, then <b>mod-flow</b> prints the
              modified flow's statistics.  A flow's statistics are the  number
              of  packets  and  bytes  that  have passed through the flow, the
              elapsed time since the flow last processed a packet  (if  ever),
              and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags processed through
              the flow.

              With  <b>--clear</b>,  <b>mod-flow</b>  zeros  out the flow's statistics.  The
              statistics printed if <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b> is also  specified  are
              those from just before clearing the statistics.

              NOTE:  <u>flow</u>  and  <u>actions</u>  do  not  match  the  syntax used with
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s <b>add-flow</b> command.

              <b>Usage</b> <b>Examples</b>

              Forward ARP between ports 1 and 2 on datapath myDP:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 1

              Forward all IPv4 traffic between two addresses on ports 1 and 2:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.4,dst=172.31.110.5)" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.5,dst=172.31.110.4)" 1

       <b>add-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
       <b>mod-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
       <b>del-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
              Reads flow entries from <u>file</u> (or <b>stdin</b> if <u>file</u> is <b>-</b>)  and  adds,
              modifies,  or  deletes  each  entry  to the datapath.  Each flow
              specification (e.g., each line in <u>file</u>) may start with <b>add</b>, <b>mod‐</b>
              <b>ify</b>, or <b>delete</b> keyword to specify whether a flow is to be added,
              modified, or deleted. A flow specification without one of  these
              keywords is treated based on the used command.  All flow modifi‐
              cations  are  executed  as  individual transactions in the order
              specified.

       [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>del-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u>
              Deletes the flow from <u>dp</u>'s flow table that matches <u>flow</u>.  If  <b>-s</b>
              or  <b>--statistics</b>  is specified, then <b>del-flow</b> prints the deleted
              flow's statistics.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names</b> | <b>--no-names</b>] <b>get-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] ufid:<u>ufid</u>
              Fetches the flow from <u>dp</u>'s flow  table  with  unique  identifier
              <u>ufid</u>.   <u>ufid</u>  must  be  specified  as a string of 32 hexadecimal
              characters.

       <b>del-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow table.

   <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>FLOW</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are useful for  debugging  and  configuring  the
       datapath flow cache settings.

       <b>cache-get-size</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints the current cache sizes to the console.

       <b>cache-set-size</b> <u>dp</u> <u>cache</u> <u>size</u>
              Set  the  <u>dp</u>'s specific <u>cache</u> to the given <u>size</u>.  The cache name
              can be found by using the <b>cache-get-size</b> command.

   <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>TRACKING</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are useful for  debugging  and  configuring  the
       connection tracking table in the datapath.

       The  <u>dp</u> argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       <b>N.B.</b>(Linux specific): the <u>system</u> datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel  mod‐
       ule  Open  vSwitch  datapaths) share a single connection tracking table
       (which is also used by other kernel subsystems, such as iptables, nfta‐
       bles and the regular host stack).  Therefore, the following commands do
       not apply specifically to one datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-enabled</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
       <b>ipf-set-disabled</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
              Enables or disables IP fragmentation handling for the  userspace
              connection  tracker.   Either  <b>v4</b> or <b>v6</b> must be specified.  Both
              IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly are enabled by default.   Only
              supported for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-min-frag</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b> <u>minfrag</u>
              Sets  the minimum fragment size (L3 header and data) for non-fi‐
              nal fragments to <u>minfrag</u>.  Either <b>v4</b> or <b>v6</b>  must  be  specified.
              For  enhanced  DOS  security,  higher minimum fragment sizes can
              usually be used.  The default IPv4 value is 1200 and the clamped
              minimum is 400.  The default IPv6 value is 1280, with a  clamped
              minimum  of  400, for testing flexibility.  The maximum fragment
              size is not clamped, however, setting this value too high  might
              result  in  valid  fragments  being dropped.  Only supported for
              userspace datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-max-nfrags</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>maxfrags</u>
              Sets the maximum number of fragments tracked  by  the  userspace
              datapath  connection  tracker to <u>maxfrags</u>.  The default value is
              1000 and the clamped maximum is 5000.  Note that packet  buffers
              can  be held by the fragmentation module while fragments are in‐
              complete, but will timeout after 15 seconds.  Memory pool sizing
              should be set accordingly when fragmentation is  enabled.   Only
              supported for userspace datapath.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] <b>ipf-get-status</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Gets the configuration settings and fragment counters associated
              with  the  fragmentation handling of the userspace datapath con‐
              nection tracker.  With <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, also dumps the IP  fragment
              lists.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>dump-conntrack</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Prints  to the console all the connection entries in the tracker
              used by <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, only shows  the  connec‐
              tions  in  <u>zone</u>.   With <b>--more</b>, some implementation specific de‐
              tails are included. With <b>--statistics</b>  timeouts  and  timestamps
              are added to the output.

       <b>dump-conntrack-exp</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Prints to the console all the expectation entries in the tracker
              used  by <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, only shows the expecta‐
              tions in <u>zone</u>. Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>flush-conntrack</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>] [<u>ct-origin-tuple</u> [<u>ct-reply-tuple</u>]]
              Flushes the connection entries in the tracker used by  <u>dp</u>  based
              on  <u>zone</u>  and connection tracking tuple <u>ct-origin-tuple</u>.  If <u>ct-</u>
              <u>tuple</u> is not provided, flushes all the connection  entries.   If
              <b>zone</b>=<u>zone</u> is specified, only flushes the connections in <u>zone</u>.

              If <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u> is provided, flushes the connection en‐
              try  specified  by  <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u> in <u>zone</u>.  The zone de‐
              faults to 0 if it is not  provided.   The  userspace  connection
              tracker  requires flushing with the original pre-NATed tuple and
              a warning log will be otherwise generated.   The  tuple  can  be
              partial and will remove all connections that are matching on the
              specified fields.  In order to specify only <u>ct-reply-tuple</u>, pro‐
              vide empty string as <u>ct-origin-tuple</u>.

              Note:  Currently  there is a limitation for matching on ICMP, in
              order to partially match on  ICMP  parameters  the  <u>ct-[orig|re‐</u>
              <u>ply]-tuple</u> has to include either source or destination IP.

              An example of an IPv4 ICMP <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u>:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u>:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] <b>ct-stats-show</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Displays  the  number of connections grouped by protocol used by
              <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, numbers refer to the connections
              in <u>zone</u>.  With <b>--more</b>, groups by connection state for each  pro‐
              tocol.

       <b>ct-bkts</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>gt=</b><u>threshold</u>]
              For  each  conntrack  bucket, displays the number of connections
              used by <u>dp</u>.  If <b>gt=</b><u>threshold</u> is specified,  bucket  numbers  are
              displayed  when the number of connections in a bucket is greater
              than <u>threshold</u>.

       <b>ct-set-maxconns</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>maxconns</u>
              Sets the maximum limit of connection tracker entries to <u>maxconns</u>
              on <u>dp</u>.  This can be used to reduce the processing  load  on  the
              system  due to connection tracking or simply limiting connection
              tracking.  If the number of connections is already over the  new
              maximum  limit  request  then  the new maximum limit will be en‐
              forced when the number of connections decreases to  that  limit,
              which normally happens due to connection expiry.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-maxconns</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints  the  maximum  limit of connection tracker entries on <u>dp</u>.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-nconns</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints the current number of connection tracker entries  on  <u>dp</u>.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-enable-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
       <b>ct-disable-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Enables  or  disables  TCP  sequence checking.  When set to dis‐
              abled, all sequence number verification is  disabled,  including
              for  TCP  resets.  This is similar, but not the same as 'be_lib‐
              eral' mode, as in Netfilter.  Disabling sequence number  verifi‐
              cation  is not an optimization in itself, but is needed for some
              hardware offload support which might offer some performance  ad‐
              vantage.  Sequence  number checking is enabled by default to en‐
              force better security and should only be  disabled  if  required
              for  hardware  offload  support.  This command is only supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints whether TCP sequence checking is enabled or  disabled  on
              <u>dp</u>.  Only supported for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-set-sweep-interval</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>ms</u>
              Sets  the sweep interval. Only supported for the userspace data‐
              path.

       <b>ct-get-sweep-interval</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints the current sweep interval in ms. Only supported for  the
              userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-set-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>default=</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>,<b>limit=</b><u>limit</u>]...
              Sets  the  maximum allowed number of connections in a connection
              tracking zone.  A specific <u>zone</u> may be set to <u>limit</u>, and  multi‐
              ple  zones  may  be specified with a comma-separated list.  If a
              per-zone limit for a particular zone is  not  specified  in  the
              datapath,  it defaults to the default per-zone limit.  A default
              zone may be specified with the  <b>default=</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u>  argument.
              Initially,  the  default per-zone limit is unlimited.  An unlim‐
              ited number of entries may be set with <b>0</b> limit.

       <b>ct-del-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>zone=</b><u>zone[,zone]</u>...
              Deletes the connection tracking limit for <u>zone</u>.  Multiple  zones
              may be specified with a comma-separated list.

       <b>ct-get-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>[<b>,</b><u>zone</u>]...]
              Retrieves  the maximum allowed number of connections and current
              counts per-zone.  If <u>zone</u> is given, only the  specified  zone(s)
              are printed.  If no zones are specified, all the zone limits and
              counts  are  provided.   The command always displays the default
              zone limit.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              Limits <b>ovs-dpctl</b> runtime to approximately <u>secs</u> seconds.  If  the
              timeout expires, <b>ovs-dpctl</b> will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.   (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,   <b>ovs-dpctl</b>
                     closes  its  standard file descriptors, so logging to the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name   used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is  <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-dpctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution needs to be taken into account, for ex‐
                     ample, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen  on
                     the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could
                     be interfering with local syslog traffic  and  there  are
                     some  security  considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.
