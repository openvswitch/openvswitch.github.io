ovs-dpctl(8)                  Open vSwitch Manual                 ovs-dpctl(8)



<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-dpctl - administer Open vSwitch datapaths

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-dpctl</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>switch</u>] [<u>args</u>...]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>ovs-dpctl</b> program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch data‐
       paths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.

       This program works only with datapaths that are implemented outside  of
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  itself,  such as the Linux and Windows kernel-based data‐
       paths.  To manage datapaths that are integrated into <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, such
       as  the  userspace  (<b>netdev</b>)  datapath, use <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) to invoke the
       <b>dpctl/*</b> commands, which are documented in <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>(8).

       A newly created datapath is associated with only one network device,  a
       virtual  network device sometimes called the datapath's ``local port''.
       A newly created datapath is not, however, associated with  any  of  the
       host's  other  network  devices.  To intercept and process traffic on a
       given network device, use the <b>add-if</b> command  to  explicitly  add  that
       network device to the datapath.

       If <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>(8) is in use, use <b>ovs-vsctl</b>(8) instead of <b>ovs-dpctl</b>.

       Most  <b>ovs-dpctl</b> commands that work with datapaths take an argument that
       specifies the name of the  datapath.   Datapath  names  take  the  form
       [<u>type</u><b>@</b>]<u>name</u>, where <u>name</u> is the network device associated with the data‐
       path's local port.   If  <u>type</u>  is  given,  it  specifies  the  datapath
       provider of <u>name</u>, otherwise the default provider <b>system</b> is assumed.

       The following commands manage datapaths.  Do not use commands to add or
       remove or modify datapaths if  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  is  running  because  this
       interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own datapath management.

       <b>add-dp</b> <u>dp</u> [<u>netdev</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...]
              Creates datapath <u>dp</u>, with a local port also named <u>dp</u>.  This will
              fail if a network device <u>dp</u> already exists.

              If <u>netdev</u>s are specified, <b>ovs-dpctl</b> adds them to the  new  data‐
              path, just as if <b>add-if</b> was specified.

       <b>del-dp</b> <u>dp</u>
              Deletes  datapath  <u>dp</u>.   If  <u>dp</u>  is  associated with any network
              devices, they are automatically removed.

       <b>add-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>netdev</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...
              Adds each <u>netdev</u> to the set of network devices datapath <u>dp</u> moni‐
              tors,  where  <u>dp</u> is the name of an existing datapath, and <u>netdev</u>
              is the name of one of the host's  network  devices,  e.g.  <b>eth0</b>.
              Once a network device has been added to a datapath, the datapath
              has complete ownership of the network device's traffic  and  the
              network device appears silent to the rest of the system.

              A  <u>netdev</u>  may be followed by a comma-separated list of options.
              The following options are currently supported:

              <b>type=</b><u>type</u>
                     Specifies the type of port to add.  The default  type  is
                     <b>system</b>.

              <b>port_no=</b><u>port</u>
                     Requests  a specific port number within the datapath.  If
                     this option is not specified then one will  be  automati‐
                     cally assigned.

              <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
                     Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's configu‐
                     ration.

              <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) documents the available port  types  and
              options.

       <b>set-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>port</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...
              Reconfigures  each  <u>port</u>  in  <u>dp</u> as specified.  An <u>option</u> of the
              form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> adds the specified key-value option to  the  port
              or  overrides  an  existing  key's value.  An <u>option</u> of the form
              <u>key</u><b>=</b>, that is, without a value, deletes the key-value named <u>key</u>.
              The  type  and  port number of a port cannot be changed, so <b>type</b>
              and <b>port_no</b> are only allowed if they match the existing configu‐
              ration.

       <b>del-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>netdev</u>...
              Removes each <u>netdev</u> from the list of network devices datapath <u>dp</u>
              monitors.

       <b>dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.

       [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>show</b> [<u>dp</u>...]
              Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their  data‐
              path  numbers  and  a  list of ports connected to each datapath.
              (The local port is identified as port 0.)  If <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b>
              is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for
              each port.

              The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega  flow  mask
              stats.

              The  "lookups"  row  displays three stats related to flow lookup
              triggered by processing incoming packets in the datapath.  "hit"
              displays number of packets matches existing flows. "missed" dis‐
              plays the number of packets not matching any existing  flow  and
              require  user space processing.  "lost" displays number of pack‐
              ets destined for user space  process  but  subsequently  dropped
              before reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss" equals to
              the total number of packets datapath processed.

              The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.

              The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This  row  is
              omitted  for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit" displays
              the total number of masks visited for matching incoming packets.
              "total" displays number of masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" dis‐
              plays the average number of masks visited per packet; the  ratio
              between "hit" and total number of packets processed by the data‐
              path.

              If one or more datapaths  are  specified,  information  on  only
              those  datapaths  are  displayed.  Otherwise, <b>ovs-dpctl</b> displays
              information about all configured datapaths.

   <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>FLOW</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.
       The  flow  table entries (both matches and actions) that they work with
       are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different and consid‐
       erably  simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module.  Do
       not use  commands  to  add  or  remove  or  modify  datapath  flows  if
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  is  running because it interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own
       datapath flow management.  Use  <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8),  instead,  to  work  with
       OpenFlow flow entries.

       The  <u>dp</u> argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       [<b>-m</b>  |  <b>--more</b>]  [<b>--names</b> | <b>--no-names</b>] <b>dump-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>filter=</b><u>filter</u>]
       [<b>type=</b><u>type</u>] [<b>pmd=</b><u>pmd</u>]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow ta‐
              ble.   Without  <b>-m</b>  or  <b>--more</b>, output omits match fields that a
              flow wildcards entirely; with <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, output includes  all
              wildcarded fields.

              If  <b>filter=</b><u>filter</u>  is  specified,  only  displays the flows that
              match the <u>filter</u>. <u>filter</u> is a flow in the form similiar to  that
              accepted  by  <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s  <b>add-flow</b>  command. (This is not an
              OpenFlow flow: besides  other  differences,  it  never  contains
              wildcards.)   The  <u>filter</u>  is  also  useful  to match wildcarded
              fields   in   the   datapath   flow.   As   an   example,   <b>fil‐</b>
              <b>ter='tcp,tp_src=100'</b>  will  match  the  datapath flow containing
              '<b>tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)</b>'.

              If <b>pmd=</b><u>pmd</u> is specified, only displays flows  of  the  specified
              pmd.  Using <b>pmd=</b><u>-1</u> will restrict the dump to flows from the main
              thread.  This option is only supported by  the  <b>userspace</b>  <b>data‐</b>
              <b>path</b>.

              If  <b>type=</b><u>type</u> is specified, only displays flows of the specified
              types.    This   option   supported    only    for    <b>ovs-appctl</b>
              <b>dpctl/dump-flows</b>.   <u>type</u>  is  a  comma separated list, which can
              contain any of the following:
                 <b>ovs</b> - displays flows handled in the ovs dp
                 <b>tc</b> - displays flows handled in the tc dp
                 <b>dpdk</b> - displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
                 <b>offloaded</b> - displays flows offloaded to the HW
                 <b>non-offloaded</b> - displays flows not offloaded to the HW
                 <b>partially-offloaded</b> - displays flows where only part of their
              proccessing is done in HW
                 <b>all</b> - displays all the types of flows

              By  default  all  the  types  of flows are displayed.  <b>ovs-dpctl</b>
              always acts as if the <b>type</b> was <u>ovs</u>.

       <b>add-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u> <u>actions</u>

       [<b>--clear</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>mod-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u> <u>actions</u>
              Adds or modifies a flow in <u>dp</u>'s flow table that, when  a  packet
              matching <u>flow</u> arrives, causes <u>actions</u> to be executed.

              The  <b>add-flow</b>  command  succeeds  only  if <u>flow</u> does not already
              exist in <u>dp</u>.  Contrariwise, <b>mod-flow</b> without  <b>--may-create</b>  only
              modifies  the  actions for an existing flow.  With <b>--may-create</b>,
              <b>mod-flow</b> will add a new flow or modify an existing one.

              If <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b> is specified,  then  <b>mod-flow</b>  prints  the
              modified  flow's statistics.  A flow's statistics are the number
              of packets and bytes that have  passed  through  the  flow,  the
              elapsed  time  since the flow last processed a packet (if ever),
              and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags processed through
              the flow.

              With  <b>--clear</b>,  <b>mod-flow</b>  zeros  out the flow's statistics.  The
              statistics printed if <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b> is also  specified  are
              those from just before clearing the statistics.

              NOTE:  <u>flow</u>  and  <u>actions</u>  do  not  match  the  syntax used with
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s <b>add-flow</b> command.

              <b>Usage</b> <b>Examples</b>

              Forward ARP between ports 1 and 2 on datapath myDP:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 1

              Forward all IPv4 traffic between two addresses on ports 1 and 2:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.4,dst=172.31.110.5)" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.5,dst=172.31.110.4)" 1

       <b>add-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
       <b>mod-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
       <b>del-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
              Reads flow entries from <u>file</u> (or <b>stdin</b> if <u>file</u> is <b>-</b>)  and  adds,
              modifies,  or  deletes  each  entry  to the datapath.  Each flow
              specification (e.g., each line in <u>file</u>) may start with <b>add</b>, <b>mod‐</b>
              <b>ify</b>, or <b>delete</b> keyword to specify whether a flow is to be added,
              modified, or deleted. A flow specification without one of  these
              keywords is treated based on the used command.  All flow modifi‐
              cations are executed as individual  transactions  in  the  order
              specified.

       [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>del-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u>
              Deletes  the flow from <u>dp</u>'s flow table that matches <u>flow</u>.  If <b>-s</b>
              or <b>--statistics</b> is specified, then <b>del-flow</b> prints  the  deleted
              flow's statistics.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names</b> | <b>--no-names</b>] <b>get-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] ufid:<u>ufid</u>
              Fetches  the  flow  from  <u>dp</u>'s flow table with unique identifier
              <u>ufid</u>.  <u>ufid</u> must be specified as  a  string  of  32  hexadecimal
              characters.

       <b>del-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow table.

   <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>TRACKING</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The  following  commands  are  useful for debugging and configuring the
       connection tracking table in the datapath.

       The <u>dp</u> argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly  one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       <b>N.B.</b>(Linux specific): the <u>system</u> datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel  mod‐
       ule  Open  vSwitch  datapaths) share a single connection tracking table
       (which is also used by other kernel subsystems, such as iptables, nfta‐
       bles and the regular host stack).  Therefore, the following commands do
       not apply specifically to one datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-enabled</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
       <b>ipf-set-disabled</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
              Enables or disables IP fragmentation handling for the  userspace
              connection  tracker.   Either  <b>v4</b> or <b>v6</b> must be specified.  Both
              IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly are enabled by default.   Only
              supported for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-min-frag</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b> <u>minfrag</u>
              Sets  the  minimum  fragment  size (L3 header and data) for non-
              final fragments to <u>minfrag</u>.  Either <b>v4</b> or <b>v6</b> must be  specified.
              For  enhanced  DOS  security,  higher minimum fragment sizes can
              usually be used.  The default IPv4 value is 1200 and the clamped
              minimum  is 400.  The default IPv6 value is 1280, with a clamped
              minimum of 400, for testing flexibility.  The  maximum  fragment
              size  is not clamped, however, setting this value too high might
              result in valid fragments being  dropped.   Only  supported  for
              userspace datapath.

       <b>ipf-set-max-nfrags</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>maxfrags</u>
              Sets  the  maximum  number of fragments tracked by the userspace
              datapath connection tracker to <u>maxfrags</u>.  The default  value  is
              1000  and the clamped maximum is 5000.  Note that packet buffers
              can be held by the  fragmentation  module  while  fragments  are
              incomplete, but will timeout after 15 seconds.  Memory pool siz‐
              ing should be set accordingly  when  fragmentation  is  enabled.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] <b>ipf-get-status</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Gets the configuration settings and fragment counters associated
              with the fragmentation handling of the userspace  datapath  con‐
              nection  tracker.  With <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, also dumps the IP fragment
              lists.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] <b>dump-conntrack</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Prints to the console all the connection entries in the  tracker
              used  by  <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, only shows the connec‐
              tions  in  <u>zone</u>.   With  <b>--more</b>,  some  implementation  specific
              details  are included. With <b>--statistics</b> timeouts and timestamps
              are added to the output.

       <b>flush-conntrack</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>] [<u>ct-tuple</u>]
              Flushes the connection entries in the tracker used by  <u>dp</u>  based
              on  <u>zone</u> and connection tracking tuple <u>ct-tuple</u>.  If <u>ct-tuple</u> is
              not provided, flushes all the connection entries.  If  <b>zone</b>=<u>zone</u>
              is specified, only flushes the connections in <u>zone</u>.

              If  <u>ct-tuple</u> is provided, flushes the connection entry specified
              by <u>ct-tuple</u> in <u>zone</u>. The zone defaults to 0 if it  is  not  pro‐
              vided.   The userspace connection tracker requires flushing with
              the original pre-NATed tuple and a warning log will be otherwise
              generated.  An example of an IPv4 ICMP <u>ct-tuple</u>:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP <u>ct-tuple</u>:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

       [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] <b>ct-stats-show</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Displays  the  number of connections grouped by protocol used by
              <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, numbers refer to the connections
              in  <u>zone</u>.  With <b>--more</b>, groups by connection state for each pro‐
              tocol.

       <b>ct-bkts</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>gt=</b><u>threshold</u>]
              For each conntrack bucket, displays the  number  of  connections
              used  by  <u>dp</u>.   If <b>gt=</b><u>threshold</u> is specified, bucket numbers are
              displayed when the number of connections in a bucket is  greater
              than <u>threshold</u>.

       <b>ct-set-maxconns</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>maxconns</u>
              Sets the maximum limit of connection tracker entries to <u>maxconns</u>
              on <u>dp</u>.  This can be used to reduce the processing  load  on  the
              system  due to connection tracking or simply limiting connection
              tracking.  If the number of connections is already over the  new
              maximum  limit  request  then  the  new  maximum  limit  will be
              enforced when the number of connections decreases to that limit,
              which normally happens due to connection expiry.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-maxconns</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints the maximum limit of connection tracker  entries  on  <u>dp</u>.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-nconns</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints  the  current number of connection tracker entries on <u>dp</u>.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-enable-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
       <b>ct-disable-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Enables or disables TCP sequence checking.   When  set  to  dis‐
              abled,  all  sequence number verification is disabled, including
              for TCP resets.  This is similar, but not the same  as  'be_lib‐
              eral'  mode, as in Netfilter.  Disabling sequence number verifi‐
              cation is not an optimization in itself, but is needed for  some
              hardware  offload  support  which  might  offer some performance
              advantage. Sequence number checking is  enabled  by  default  to
              enforce  better security and should only be disabled if required
              for hardware offload support.  This command  is  only  supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-get-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints  whether  TCP sequence checking is enabled or disabled on
              <u>dp</u>.  Only supported for the userspace datapath.

       <b>ct-set-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>default=</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>,<b>limit=</b><u>limit</u>]...
              Sets the maximum allowed number of connections in  a  connection
              tracking  zone.  A specific <u>zone</u> may be set to <u>limit</u>, and multi‐
              ple zones may be specified with a comma-separated  list.   If  a
              per-zone  limit  for  a  particular zone is not specified in the
              datapath, it defaults to the default per-zone limit.  A  default
              zone  may  be specified with the <b>default=</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u> argument.
              Initially, the default per-zone limit is unlimited.   An  unlim‐
              ited number of entries may be set with <b>0</b> limit.

       <b>ct-del-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>zone=</b><u>zone[,zone]</u>...
              Deletes  the connection tracking limit for <u>zone</u>.  Multiple zones
              may be specified with a comma-separated list.

       <b>ct-get-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>[<b>,</b><u>zone</u>]...]
              Retrieves the maximum allowed number of connections and  current
              counts  per-zone.   If <u>zone</u> is given, only the specified zone(s)
              are printed.  If no zones are specified, all the zone limits and
              counts  are  provided.   The command always displays the default
              zone limit.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              Limits <b>ovs-dpctl</b> runtime to approximately <u>secs</u> seconds.  If  the
              timeout expires, <b>ovs-dpctl</b> will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              ·      A valid module name, as displayed by the  <b>vlog/list</b>  com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              ·      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.   (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,   <b>ovs-dpctl</b>
                     closes  its  standard file descriptors, so logging to the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              ·      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will  not  take  place  unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see
              below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name    used    if    <u>file</u>    is   omitted   is   <b>/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-dpctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              ·      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              ·      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              ·      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution  needs  to  be  taken into account, for
                     example, syslog daemon needs to be configured  to  listen
                     on  the  specified  UDP  port,  accidental iptables rules
                     could be interfering with local syslog traffic and  there
                     are  some security considerations that apply to UDP sock‐
                     ets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              ·      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.
