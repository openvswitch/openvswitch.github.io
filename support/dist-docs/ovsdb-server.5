ovsdb-server \- _Server database schema
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
Every \fBovsdb\-server\fR (version 2\[char46]9 or later) always hosts an instance of this schema, which holds information on the status and configuration of the server itself\[char46] This database is read-only\[char46] This manpage describes the schema for this database\[char46]
.SH "TABLE SUMMARY"
.PP
The following list summarizes the purpose of each of the tables in the
\fB_Server\fR database.  Each table is described in more detail on a later
page.

.SH "Database TABLE"
.PP
.PP
.PP
This table describes the databases hosted by the database server, with one row per database\[char46] As its database configuration and status changes, the server automatically and immediately updates the table to match\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The OVSDB protocol specified in RFC 7047 does not provide a way for an OVSDB client to find out about some kinds of configuration changes, such as about databases added or removed while a client is connected to the server, or databases changing between read/write and read-only due to a transition between active and backup roles\[char46] This table provides a solution: clients can monitor the table\(cqs contents to find out about important changes\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Traditionally, \fBovsdb\-server\fR disconnects all of its clients when a significant configuration change occurs, because this prompts a well-written client to reassess what is available from the server when it reconnects\[char46] Because this table provides an alternative and more efficient way to find out about those changes, OVS 2\[char46]9 also introduces the \fBset_db_change_aware\fR RPC, documented in \fBovsdb\-server\fR(7), to allow clients to suppress this disconnection behavior\[char46]
.PP
.PP
When a database is removed from the server, in addition to \fBDatabase\fR table updates, the server sends \fBcanceled\fR messages, as described in RFC 7047 section 4\[char46]1\[char46]4, in reply to outstanding transactions for the removed database\[char46] The server also cancels any outstanding monitoring initiated by \fBmonitor\fR or \fBmonitor_cond\fR requested on the removed database, sending the \fBmonitor_canceled\fR RPC described in \fBovsdb\-server\fR(7)\[char46] Only clients that disable disconnection with \fBset_db_change_aware\fR receive these messages\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Clients can use the \fB_uuid\fR column in this table as a generation number\[char46] The server generates a fresh \fB_uuid\fR every time it adds a database, so that removing and then re-adding a database to the server causes its row \fB_uuid\fR to change\[char46]

.SS "Details:
.IP "\fBname\fR: string"
The database\(cqs name, as specified in its schema\[char46]
.IP "\fBmodel\fR: string, one of \fBclustered\fR, \fBrelay\fR, or \fBstandalone\fR"
The storage model: \fBstandalone\fR for a standalone or active-backup database, \fBclustered\fR for a clustered database, \fBrelay\fR for a relay database\[char46]
.IP "\fBschema\fR: optional string"
The database schema, as a JSON string\[char46] In the case of a clustered database, this is empty until it finishes joining its cluster\[char46] In the case of a relay database, this is empty until it connects to the relay source\[char46]
.IP "\fBconnected\fR: boolean"
True if the database is connected to its storage\[char46] A standalone database is always connected\[char46] A clustered database is connected if the server is in contact with a majority of its cluster\[char46] A relay database is connected if the server is in contact with the relay source, i\[char46]e\[char46] is connected to the server it syncs from\[char46] An unconnected database cannot be modified and its data might be unavailable or stale\[char46]
.ST "Clustered Databases:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
These columns are most interesting and in some cases only relevant for clustered databases, that is, those where the \fBmodel\fR column is \fBclustered\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBleader\fR: boolean"
True if the database is the leader in its cluster\[char46] For a standalone or active-backup database, this is always true\[char46] For a relay database, this is always false\[char46]
.IP "\fBcid\fR: optional uuid"
The cluster ID for this database, which is the same for all of the servers that host this particular clustered database\[char46] For a standalone, active-backup or relay database, this is empty\[char46]
.IP "\fBsid\fR: optional uuid"
The server ID for this database, different for each server that hosts a particular clustered database\[char46] A server that hosts more than one clustered database will have a different \fBsid\fR in each one\[char46] For a standalone, active-backup or relay database, this is empty\[char46]
.IP "\fBindex\fR: optional integer"
For a clustered database, the index of the log entry currently exposed to clients\[char46] For a given server, this increases monotonically\[char46] When a client switches from one server to another in a cluster, it can ensure that it never sees an older snapshot of data by avoiding servers that have \fBindex\fR less than the largest value they have already observed\[char46]
.IP
For a standalone, active-backup or relay database, this is empty\[char46]
