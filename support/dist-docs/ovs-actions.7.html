<u>OVS-ACTIONS</u>(7)                   Open vSwitch                   <u>OVS-ACTIONS</u>(7)

<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-actions  -  OpenFlow actions and instructions with Open vSwitch ex‐
       tensions

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
       This document aims to comprehensively document all of the OpenFlow  ac‐
       tions  and  instructions,  both standard and non-standard, supported by
       Open vSwitch, regardless of origin.  The document includes  information
       of  interest  to Open vSwitch users, such as the semantics of each sup‐
       ported action and the syntax used by Open vSwitch tools, and to  devel‐
       opers  seeking  to  build controllers and switches compatible with Open
       vSwitch, such as the wire format for each supported message.

   <b>Actions</b>
       In this document, we define an <b>action</b> as an OpenFlow action, which is a
       kind of command that specifies what to do with a packet.   Actions  are
       used  in  OpenFlow flows to describe what to do when the flow matches a
       packet, and in a few other places in OpenFlow.   Each  version  of  the
       OpenFlow  specification  defines standard actions, and beyond that many
       OpenFlow switches, including Open vSwitch, implement extensions to  the
       standard.

       OpenFlow  groups  actions  in  two ways: as an <b>action</b> <b>list</b> or an <b>action</b>
       <b>set</b>, described below.

   <b>Action</b> <b>Lists</b>
       An <b>action</b> <b>list</b>, a concept present in every version of OpenFlow, is sim‐
       ply an ordered sequence of actions.  The  OpenFlow  specifications  re‐
       quire  a  switch  to execute actions within an action list in the order
       specified, and to refuse to execute an action list entirely if it  can‐
       not  implement  the  actions in that order [OpenFlow 1.0, section 3.3],
       with one exception: when an action list outputs multiple  packets,  the
       switch  may  output  the packets in an order different from that speci‐
       fied.  Usually, this exception is not important, especially in the com‐
       mon case when the packets are output to different ports.

   <b>Action</b> <b>Sets</b>
       OpenFlow 1.1 introduced the concept of an <b>action</b> <b>set</b>.  An action set is
       also a sequence of actions, but the switch  reorders  the  actions  and
       drops  duplicates according to rules specified in the OpenFlow specifi‐
       cations.  Because of these semantics, some  standard  OpenFlow  actions
       cannot  usefully  be included in an action set.  For some, but not all,
       Open vSwitch extension actions, Open vSwitch defines its own action set
       semantics and ordering.

       The OpenFlow pipeline has an action set associated with it as a  packet
       is  processed.   After  pipeline  processing is otherwise complete, the
       switch executes the actions in the action set.

       Open vSwitch applies actions in an action set in the  following  order:
       Except as noted otherwise below, the action set only executes at most a
       single  action  of  each type, and when more than one action of a given
       type is present, the one added to the set later  replaces  the  earlier
       action:

          1.  <b>strip_vlan</b>

          2.  <b>pop_mpls</b>

          3.  <b>decap</b>

          4.  <b>encap</b>

          5.  <b>push_mpls</b>

          6.  <b>push_vlan</b>

          7.  <b>dec_ttl</b>

          8.  <b>dec_mpls_ttl</b>

          9.  <b>dec_nsh_ttl</b>

          10. All  of the following actions are executed in the order added to
              the action set, with cumulative effect.  That is, when  multiple
              actions  modify the same part of a field, the later modification
              takes effect, and when they modify different parts  of  a  field
              (or different fields), then both modifications are applied:

                  • <b>load</b>

                  • <b>move</b>

                  • <b>mod_dl_dst</b>

                  • <b>mod_dl_src</b>

                  • <b>mod_nw_dst</b>

                  • <b>mod_nw_src</b>

                  • <b>mod_nw_tos</b>

                  • <b>mod_nw_ecn</b>

                  • <b>mod_nw_ttl</b>

                  • <b>mod_tp_dst</b>

                  • <b>mod_tp_src</b>

                  • <b>mod_vlan_pcp</b>

                  • <b>mod_vlan_vid</b>

                  • <b>set_field</b>

                  • <b>set_tunnel</b>

                  • <b>set_tunnel64</b>

          11. <b>set_queue</b>

          12. <b>group</b>,  <b>output</b>,  <b>resubmit</b>, <b>ct_clear</b>, or <b>ct</b>.  If more than one of
              these actions is present, then the one listed earliest above  is
              executed  and the others are ignored, regardless of the order in
              which they were added to the action set.  (If none of these  ac‐
              tions is present, the action set has no real effect, because the
              modified  packet is not sent anywhere and thus the modifications
              are not visible.)

       An action set may only contain the actions listed above.

   <b>Error</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Packet processing can encounter a variety of errors:

       <b>Bridge</b> <b>not</b> <b>found</b>
              Open vSwitch supports an extension to the standard OpenFlow <b>con‐</b>
              <b>troller</b> action called a  <b>continuation</b>,  which  allows  the  con‐
              troller to interrupt and later resume the processing of a packet
              through  the  switch  pipeline.   This  error occurs when such a
              packet’s processing cannot be resumed, e.g.  because the  bridge
              processing it has been destroyed.  Open vSwitch reports this er‐
              ror to the controller as Open vSwitch extension error <b>NXR_STALE</b>.

              This error prevents packet processing entirely.

       <b>Recursion</b> <b>too</b> <b>deep</b>
              While  processing  a  given packet, Open vSwitch limits the flow
              table recursion depth to 64, to ensure  that  packet  processing
              uses  a  finite  amount  of  time and space.  Actions that count
              against the recursion limit include <b>resubmit</b> from a given  Open‐
              Flow table to the same or an earlier table, <b>group</b>, and <b>output</b> to
              patch ports.

              A  <b>resubmit</b>  from  one table to a later one (or, equivalently, a
              <b>goto_table</b> instruction) does not count against the  depth  limit
              because  resubmits  to  strictly monotonically increasing tables
              will eventually terminate.  OpenFlow tables  are  most  commonly
              traversed  in  numerically  increasing  order, so this limit has
              little effect on conventionally designed OpenFlow pipelines.

              This error terminates packet processing.  Any previous side  ef‐
              fects (e.g. output actions) are retained.

              Usually this error indicates a loop or other bug in the OpenFlow
              flow  tables.  To assist debugging, when this error occurs, Open
              vSwitch 2.10 and later logs a trace of the packet execution,  as
              if  by  <b>ovs-appctl</b> <b>ofproto/trace</b>, rate-limited to one per minute
              to reduce the log volume.

       <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>resubmits</b>
              Open vSwitch limits the total number of <b>resubmit</b> actions that  a
              given packet can execute to 4,096.  For this purpose, <b>goto_table</b>
              instructions  and  output to the <b>table</b> port are treated like <b>re‐</b>
              <b>submit</b>.  This limits the amount of  time  to  process  a  single
              packet.

              Unlike  the  limit  on  recursion  depth, the limit on resubmits
              counts all resubmits, regardless of direction.

              This error has the same effect, including logging, as  exceeding
              the recursion depth limit.

       <b>Stack</b> <b>too</b> <b>deep</b>
              Open  vSwitch limits the amount of data that the <b>push</b> action can
              put onto the stack at one time to 64 kB of data.

              This error terminates packet processing.  Any previous side  ef‐
              fects (e.g. output actions) are retained.

       <b>No</b> <b>recirculation</b> <b>context</b> <b>/</b> <b>Recirculation</b> <b>conflict</b>
              These  errors  indicate  internal errors inside Open vSwitch and
              should generally not occur.  If you notice  recurring  log  mes‐
              sages about these errors, please report a bug.

       <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>MPLS</b> <b>labels</b>
              Open vSwitch can process packets with any number of MPLS labels,
              but  its  ability  to  push and pop MPLS labels is limited, cur‐
              rently to 3 labels.  Attempting to push more than the  supported
              number  of  labels onto a packet, or to pop any number of labels
              from a packet with more than the supported number,  raises  this
              error.

              This  error terminates packet processing, retaining any previous
              side effects (e.g. output  actions).   When  this  error  arises
              within  the execution of a group bucket, it only terminates that
              bucket’s execution, not packet processing overall.

       <b>Invalid</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>metadata</b>
              Open vSwitch raises this error when it processes a Geneve packet
              that has TLV options with an invalid form, e.g. where the length
              in a TLV would extend past the end of the options.

              This error prevents packet processing entirely.

       <b>Unsupported</b> <b>packet</b> <b>type</b>
              When a <b>encap</b> action encapsulates a packet, Open  vSwitch  raises
              this error if it does not support the combination of the new en‐
              capsulation  with  the  current  packet.  <b>encap(ethernet)</b> raises
              this error if the current packet is not an L3  packet,  and  <b>en‐</b>
              <b>cap(nsh)</b>  raises  this error if the current packet is not Ether‐
              net, IPv4, IPv6, or NSH.

              The <b>decap</b> action is supported only for  packet  types  ethernet,
              NSH  and  MPLS.   Openvswitch raises this error for other packet
              types.  When a <b>decap</b> action decapsulates a packet, Open  vSwitch
              raises  this  error  if  it  does  not support the type of inner
              packet.  <b>decap</b> of an Ethernet header raises this error if a VLAN
              header is present, <b>decap</b> of a NSH packet raises  this  error  if
              the NSH inner packet is not Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, or NSH.

              This  error terminates packet processing, retaining any previous
              side effects (e.g. output  actions).   When  this  error  arises
              within  the execution of a group bucket, it only terminates that
              bucket’s execution, not packet processing overall.

   <b>Inconsistencies</b>
       OpenFlow 1.0 allows any action to be part of any  flow,  regardless  of
       the  flow’s  match.   Some  combinations  do  not  make  sense, e.g. an
       <b>set_nw_tos</b> action in a flow that matches only ARP packets or <b>strip_vlan</b>
       in a flow that matches packets without VLAN tags.   Other  combinations
       have  varying  results  depending  on  the kind of packet that the flow
       processes, e.g. a <b>set_nw_src</b> action in a flow that does  not  match  on
       Ethertype  will  be  treated  as  a  no-op when it processes a non-IPv4
       packet.  Nevertheless OVS allows all of the above in  conformance  with
       OpenFlow 1.0, that is, the following will succeed:

          $ ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow10 add-flow br0 arp,actions=mod_nw_tos:12
          $ ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow10 add-flow br0 dl_vlan=0xffff,actions=strip_vlan
          $ ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow10 add-flow br0 actions=mod_nw_src:1.2.3.4

       Open  vSwitch calls these kinds of combinations <b>inconsistencies</b> between
       match and actions.  OpenFlow 1.1 and later forbid inconsistencies,  and
       disallow the examples described above by preventing such flows from be‐
       ing added.  All of the above, for example, will fail with an error mes‐
       sage if one replaces <b>OpenFlow10</b> by <b>OpenFlow11</b>.

       OpenFlow  1.1 and later cannot detect and disallow all inconsistencies.
       For example, the <b>write_actions</b> instruction arbitrarily delays execution
       of the actions inside it, which can even  be  canceled  with  <b>clear_ac‐</b>
       <b>tions</b>,  so  that there is no way to ensure that its actions are consis‐
       tent with the packet at the time  they  execute.   Thus,  actions  with
       <b>write_actions</b>  and  some other contexts are exempt from consistency re‐
       quirements.

       When OVS executes an action inconsistent with the packet, it treats  it
       as a no-op.

   <b>Inter-Version</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       Open  vSwitch  supports  multiple OpenFlow versions simultaneously on a
       single switch.  When actions are added with one  OpenFlow  version  and
       then  retrieved  with  another, Open vSwitch does its best to translate
       between them.

       Inter-version compatibility issues can still arise when different  con‐
       nections  use  different  OpenFlow versions.  Backward compatibility is
       the most obvious case.  Suppose, for example, that an OpenFlow 1.1 ses‐
       sion adds a flow with a <b>push_vlan</b> action, for which there is no equiva‐
       lent in OpenFlow 1.0.  If an OpenFlow 1.0 session retrieves this  flow,
       Open vSwitch must somehow represent the action.

       Forward compatibility can also be an issue, because later OpenFlow ver‐
       sions  sometimes remove functionality.  The best example is the <b>enqueue</b>
       action from OpenFlow 1.0, which OpenFlow 1.1 removed.

       In practice, Open vSwitch uses a variety of strategies  for  inter-ver‐
       sion compatibility:

       • Most  standard  OpenFlow  actions,  such as <b>output</b> actions, translate
         without compatibility issues.

       • Open vSwitch supports its extension actions in  every  OpenFlow  ver‐
         sion, so they do not pose inter-version compatibility problems.

       • Open  vSwitch  sometimes adds extension actions to ensure backward or
         forward compatibility.  For example, for backward compatibility  with
         the  <b>group</b>  action  added  in  OpenFlow 1.1, Open vSwitch includes an
         OpenFlow 1.0 extension <b>group</b> action.

       Perfect inter-version compatibility is not possible,  so  best  results
       require  OpenFlow connections to use a consistent version.  One may en‐
       force use of a particular version by setting the <b>protocols</b> column for a
       bridge, e.g. to force <b>br0</b> to use only OpenFlow 1.3:

          ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 protocols=OpenFlow13

   <b>Field</b> <b>Specifications</b>
       Many Open vSwitch actions refer to fields.  In such cases,  fields  may
       usually  be  referred to by their common names, such as <b>eth_dst</b> for the
       Ethernet destination field, or by their full OXM or NXM names, such  as
       <b>NXM_OF_ETH_DST</b> or <b>OXM_OF_ETH_DST</b>.  Before Open vSwitch 2.7, only OXM or
       NXM field names were accepted.

       Many  actions  that  act  on fields can also act on <b>subfields</b>, that is,
       parts of fields, written as <b>field[start..end]</b>, where <b>start</b> is the first
       bit and <b>end</b> is the last bit to use in <b>field</b>, e.g. <b>vlan_tci[13..15]</b>  for
       the  VLAN PCP.  A single-bit subfield may also be written as <b>field[off‐</b>
       <b>set]</b>, e.g. <b>vlan_tci[13]</b> for the least-significant bit of the VLAN  PCP.
       Empty  brackets  may  be  used to explicitly designate an entire field,
       e.g.  <b>vlan_tci[]</b> for the entire 16-bit VLAN TCI  header.   Before  Open
       vSwitch 2.7, brackets were required in field specifications.

       See <b>ovs-fields(7)</b> for a list of fields and their names.

   <b>Port</b> <b>Specifications</b>
       Many  Open vSwitch actions refer to OpenFlow ports.  In such cases, the
       port may be specified as a numeric  port  number  in  the  range  0  to
       65,535,  although Open vSwitch only assigns port numbers in the range 1
       through 62,279 to ports.  OpenFlow 1.1 and later use 32-bit  port  num‐
       bers,  but  Open vSwitch never assigns a port number that requires more
       than 16 bits.

       In most contexts, the name of a port may also be used.  (The most obvi‐
       ous context where a port name may not be used is in an  <b>ovs-ofctl</b>  com‐
       mand  along  with  the <b>--no-names</b> option.)  When a port’s name contains
       punctuation or could be ambiguous with other actions, the name  may  be
       enclosed in double quotes, with JSON-like string escapes supported (see
       [RFC 8259]).

       Open  vSwitch  also supports the following standard OpenFlow port names
       (even in contexts where port names are not otherwise  supported).   The
       corresponding  OpenFlow  1.0 and 1.1+ port numbers are listed alongside
       them but should not be used in flow syntax:

          • <b>in_port</b> (65528 or 0xfff8; 0xfffffff8)

          • <b>table</b> (65529 or 0xfff9; 0xfffffff9)

          • <b>normal</b> (65530 or 0xfffa; 0xfffffffa)

          • <b>flood</b> (65531 or 0xfffb; 0xfffffffb)

          • <b>all</b> (65532 or 0xfffc; 0xfffffffc)

          • <b>controller</b> (65533 or 0xfffd; 0xfffffffd)

          • <b>local</b> (65534 or 0xfffe; 0xfffffffe)

          • <b>any</b> or <b>none</b> (65535 or 0xffff; 0xffffffff)

          • <b>unset</b> (not in OpenFlow 1.0; 0xfffffff7)

<b>OUTPUT</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
       These actions send a packet to a physical  port  or  a  controller.   A
       packet  that  never encounters an output action on its trip through the
       Open vSwitch pipeline is effectively dropped.  Because actions are exe‐
       cuted in order, a packet modification action  that  is  not  eventually
       followed  by  an  output action will not have an externally visible ef‐
       fect.

   <b>The</b> <b>output</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <u>port</u>
              <b>output:</b><u>port</u>
              <b>output:</b><u>field</u>
              <b>output(port=</b><u>port</u><b>,</b> <b>max_len=</b><u>nbytes</u><b>)</b>


       Outputs the packet to an OpenFlow port most commonly specified as <u>port</u>.
       Alternatively, the output port may be read from <u>field</u>, a field or  sub‐
       field in the syntax described under <u>Field</u> <u>Specifications</u> above.  Either
       way, if the port is the packet’s input port, the packet is not output.

       The <u>port</u> may be one of the following standard OpenFlow ports:

          <b>local</b>  Outputs  the packet on the <b>local</b> <b>port</b> that corresponds to the
                 network device that has the same name as the  bridge,  unless
                 the  packet  was received on the local port.  OpenFlow switch
                 implementations are not required to have a  local  port,  but
                 Open vSwitch bridges always do.

          <b>in_port</b>
                 Outputs  the  packet  on  the  port on which it was received.
                 This is the only standard way to output the packet to the in‐
                 put port (but see <u>Output</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Input</u> <u>port</u>, below).

       The <u>port</u> may also be one of the following  additional  OpenFlow  ports,
       unless <b>max_len</b> is specified:

          <b>normal</b> Subjects  the packet to the device’s normal L2/L3 processing.
                 This action is not implemented by all OpenFlow switches,  and
                 each  switch  implements it differently.  The section <u>The</u> <u>OVS</u>
                 <u>Normal</u> <u>Pipeline</u> below documents the OVS implementation.

          <b>flood</b>  Outputs the packet on all switch physical ports,  except  the
                 port on which it was received and any ports on which flooding
                 is  disabled.   Flooding  can  be disabled automatically on a
                 port by Open vSwitch when IEEE 802.1D spanning tree (STP)  or
                 rapid spanning tree (RSTP) is enabled, or by a controller us‐
                 ing  an  OpenFlow <b>OFPT_MOD_PORT</b> request to set the port’s <b>OF‐</b>
                 <b>PPC_NO_FLOOD</b> flag (<b>ovs-ofctl</b> <b>mod-port</b> provides a command-line
                 interface to set this flag).

          <b>all</b>    Outputs the packet on all switch physical  ports  except  the
                 port on which it was received.

          <b>controller</b>
                 Sends  the  packet and its metadata to an OpenFlow controller
                 or controllers encapsulated in an OpenFlow <b>packet-in</b> message.
                 The separate <b>controller</b>  action,  described  below,  provides
                 more options for output to a controller.

       Open vSwitch rejects output to other standard OpenFlow ports, including
       <b>none</b>,  <b>unset</b>,  and  port  numbers  reserved  for future use as standard
       ports, with the error <b>OFPBAC_BAD_OUT_PORT</b>.

       With <b>max_len</b>, the packet is truncated to at most  <u>nbytes</u>  bytes  before
       being  output.   In this case, the output port may not be a patch port.
       Truncation is just for the single output action, so that later  actions
       in the OpenFlow pipeline work with the complete packet.  The truncation
       feature is meant for use in monitoring applications, e.g. for mirroring
       packets to a collector.

       When an <b>output</b> action specifies the number of a port that does not cur‐
       rently exist (and is not in the range for standard ports), the OpenFlow
       specification  allows  but  does  not require OVS to reject the action.
       All versions of Open vSwitch treat such an action as  a  no-op.   If  a
       port  with the number is created later, then the action will be honored
       at that point.  (OpenFlow requires OVS to reject output to a port  num‐
       ber that will never be valid, with <b>OFPBAC_BAD_OUT_PORT</b>, but this situa‐
       tion  does  not arise when OVS is a software switch, since the user can
       add or renumber ports at any time.)

       A controller can suppress output to a port by setting its <b>OFPPC_NO_FOR‐</b>
       <b>WARD</b> flag using an OpenFlow <b>OFPT_MOD_PORT</b> request  (<b>ovs-ofctl</b>  <b>mod-port</b>
       provides  a  command-line  interface to set this flag).  When output is
       disabled, <b>output</b> actions (and other actions that output  to  the  port)
       are allowed but have no effect.

       Open  vSwitch  allows  output  to  a port that does not exist, although
       OpenFlow allows switches to reject such actions.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              All versions of OpenFlow and Open vSwitch support  <b>output</b>  to  a
              literal <b>port</b>.  Output to a register is an OpenFlow extension in‐
              troduced  in  Open  vSwitch  1.3.   Output with truncation is an
              OpenFlow extension introduced in Open vSwitch 2.6.

   <b>Output</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Port</b>
       OpenFlow requires a switch to ignore attempts to send a packet out  its
       ingress  port in the most straightforward way.  For example, <b>output:234</b>
       has no effect if the packet has ingress port  234.   The  rationale  is
       that dropping these packets makes it harder to loop the network.  Some‐
       times  this  behavior  can even be convenient, e.g. it is often the de‐
       sired behavior in a flow  that  forwards  a  packet  to  several  ports
       (<b>floods</b> the packet).

       Sometimes one really needs to send a packet out its ingress port (<b>hair‐</b>
       <b>pin</b>).  In this case, use <b>in_port</b> to explicitly output the packet to its
       input port, e.g.:

          $ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 in_port=2,actions=in_port

       This  also  works in some circumstances where the flow doesn’t match on
       the input port.  For example, if you know that  your  switch  has  five
       ports numbered 2 through 6, then the following will send every received
       packet out every port, even its ingress port:

          $ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 actions=2,3,4,5,6,in_port

       or, equivalently:

          $ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 actions=all,in_port

       Sometimes,  in complicated flow tables with multiple levels of <b>resubmit</b>
       actions, a flow needs to output to a particular port that  may  or  may
       not be the ingress port.  It’s difficult to take advantage of output to
       <b>in_port</b> in this situation.  To help, Open vSwitch provides, as an Open‐
       Flow  extension,  the  ability  to  modify the <b>in_port</b> field.  Whatever
       value is currently in the <b>in_port</b> field is both the port to which  out‐
       put  will  be dropped and the destination for <b>in_port</b>.  This means that
       the following adds flows that reliably output to port 2 or to  ports  2
       through 6, respectively:

          $ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "in_port=2,actions=load:0-&gt;in_port,2"
          $ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "actions=load:0-&gt;in_port,2,3,4,5,6"

       If <b>in_port</b> is important for matching or other reasons, one may save and
       restore it on the stack:

          $ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
                actions="push:in_port,load:0-&gt;in_port,2,3,4,5,6,pop:in_port"

   <b>The</b> <b>OVS</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>Pipeline</b>
       This section documents how Open vSwitch implements output to the <b>normal</b>
       port.   The  OpenFlow  specification places no requirements on how this
       port works, so all of this documentation is specific to Open vSwitch.

       Open   vSwitch   uses   the   <b>Open_vSwitch</b>   database,   detailed    in
       <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</b>,   to  determine  the  details  of  the  normal
       pipeline.

       The normal pipeline executes the  following  ingress  stages  for  each
       packet.  Each stage either accepts the packet, in which case the packet
       goes  on  to  the next stage, or drops the packet, which terminates the
       pipeline.  The result of the ingress stages is a set of  output  ports,
       which is the empty set if some ingress stage drops the packet:

       1.  <b>Input</b>  <b>port</b>  <b>lookup</b>: Looks up the OpenFlow <b>in_port</b> field’s value to
           the corresponding <b>Port</b> and <b>Interface</b> record in the database.

           The <b>in_port</b> is normally the OpenFlow port that the packet  was  re‐
           ceived  on.   If  <b>set_field</b> or another actions changes the <b>in_port</b>,
           the updated value is honored.  Accept the packet if the lookup suc‐
           ceeds, which it normally will.  If the lookup  fails,  for  example
           because <b>in_port</b> was changed to an unknown value, drop the packet.

       2.  <b>Drop</b>  <b>malformed</b>  <b>packet</b>:  If the packet is malformed enough that it
           contains only part of an 802.1Q header, then drop the  packet  with
           an error.

       3.  <b>Drop</b>  <b>packets</b>  <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>mirroring</b>: If the packet
           was received on a port that is configured as the output port for  a
           mirror (that is, it is the <b>output_port</b> in some <b>Mirror</b> record), then
           drop the packet.

       4.  <b>VLAN</b>  <b>input</b>  <b>processing</b>: This stage determines what VLAN the packet
           is in.  It also verifies that this VLAN is valid for the  port;  if
           not,  drop  the  packet.  How the VLAN is determined and which ones
           are valid vary based on the <b>vlan-mode</b>  in  the  input  port’s  <b>Port</b>
           record:

              <b>trunk</b>  The packet is in the VLAN specified in its 802.1Q header,
                     or  in  VLAN  0 if there is no 802.1Q header.  The <b>trunks</b>
                     column in the <b>Port</b> record lists the valid VLANs; if it is
                     empty, all VLANs are valid.

              <b>access</b> The packet is in the VLAN specified in the <b>tag</b> column  of
                     its  <b>Port</b>  record.   The  packet  must not have an 802.1Q
                     header with a nonzero VLAN  ID;  if  it  does,  drop  the
                     packet.

              <b>native-tagged</b> <b>/</b> <b>native-untagged</b>
                     Same as <b>trunk</b> except that the VLAN of a packet without an
                     802.1Q  header  is  not  necessarily zero; instead, it is
                     taken from the <b>tag</b> column.

              <b>dot1q-tunnel</b>
                     The packet is in the VLAN specified in the <b>tag</b> column  of
                     its  <b>Port</b>  record,  which is a QinQ service VLAN with the
                     Ethertype   specified   by    the    <b>Port</b>’s    <b>other_con‐</b>
                     <b>fig:qinq-ethtype</b>.   If  the  packet has an 802.1Q header,
                     then it specifies the customer VLAN.  The  <b>cvlans</b>  column
                     specifies  the  valid customer VLANs; if it is empty, all
                     customer VLANs are valid.

       5.  <b>Drop</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses</b>: If the packet is addressed to  a
           reserved  Ethernet multicast address and the <b>Bridge</b> record does not
           have <b>other_config:forward-bpdu</b> set to <b>true</b>, drop the packet.

       6.  <b>LACP</b> <b>bond</b> <b>admissibility</b>: This step applies only if the  input  port
           is  a  member  of  a bond (a <b>Port</b> with more than one <b>Interface</b>) and
           that bond is configured to use LACP. Otherwise, skip  to  the  next
           step.

           The behavior here depends on the state of LACP negotiation:

              • If  LACP  has been negotiated with the peer, accept the packet
                if the bond member is enabled  (i.e.  carrier  is  up  and  it
                hasn’t  been  administratively disabled).  Otherwise, drop the
                packet.

              • If LACP negotiation  is  incomplete,  then  drop  the  packet.
                There  is  one exception: if fallback to active-backup mode is
                enabled, continue with the next step, pretending that the  ac‐
                tive-backup balancing mode is in use.

       7.  <b>Non-LACP</b> <b>bond</b> <b>admissibility</b>: This step applies if the input port is
           a member of a bond without LACP configured, or if a LACP bond falls
           back  to  active-backup as described in the previous step.  If nei‐
           ther of these applies, skip to the next step.

           If the packet is an Ethernet multicast or broadcast,  and  not  re‐
           ceived on the bond’s active member, drop the packet.

           The remaining behavior depends on the bond’s balancing mode:

              <b>L4</b> <b>(aka</b> <b>TCP</b> <b>balancing)</b>
                     Drop  the  packet  (this balancing mode is only supported
                     with LACP).

              <b>Active-backup</b>
                     Accept the packet only if it was received on  the  active
                     member.

              <b>SLB</b> <b>(Source</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Balancing)</b>
                     Drop  the  packet  if  the  bridge  has  not  learned the
                     packet’s source address (in its VLAN) on  the  port  that
                     received it.  Otherwise, accept the packet unless it is a
                     gratuitous  ARP.  Otherwise, accept the packet if the MAC
                     entry  we  found  is  ARP-locked.   Otherwise,  drop  the
                     packet.   (See the <b>SLB</b> <b>Bonding</b> section in the OVS bonding
                     document for more information and a rationale.)

       8.  <b>Learn</b> <b>source</b> <b>MAC</b>: If the source Ethernet address is not a multicast
           address, then insert a mapping from packet’s  source  Ethernet  ad‐
           dress  and  VLAN to the input port in the bridge’s MAC learning ta‐
           ble.  (This is skipped if  the  packet’s  VLAN  is  listed  in  the
           switch’s <b>Bridge</b> record in the <b>flood_vlans</b> column, since there is no
           use for MAC learning when all packets are flooded.)

           When learning happens on a non-bond port, if the packet is a gratu‐
           itous ARP, the entry is marked as ARP-locked.  The lock expires af‐
           ter  5  seconds.   (See  the <b>SLB</b> <b>Bonding</b> section in the OVS bonding
           document for more information and a rationale.)

       9.  <b>IP</b> <b>multicast</b> <b>path</b>: If multicast snooping is enabled on the  bridge,
           and  the packet is an Ethernet multicast but not an Ethernet broad‐
           cast, and the packet is an IP packet, then the packet takes a  spe‐
           cial processing path.  This path is not yet documented here.

       10. <b>Output</b>  <b>port</b> <b>set</b>: Search the MAC learning table for the port corre‐
           sponding to the packet’s Ethernet destination  and  VLAN.   If  the
           search  finds  an  entry,  the  output port set is just the learned
           port.  Otherwise (including the case where the packet is an  Ether‐
           net multicast or in <b>flood_vlans</b>), the output port set is all of the
           ports  in  the  bridge that belong to the packet’s VLAN, except for
           any ports that were disabled for flooding via OpenFlow or that  are
           configured in a <b>Mirror</b> record as a mirror destination port.

       The following egress stages execute once for each element in the set of
       output ports.  They execute (conceptually) in parallel, so that a deci‐
       sion or action taken for a given output port has no effect on those for
       another one:

       1. <b>Drop</b>  <b>loopback</b>:  If  the  output port is the same as the input port,
          drop the packet.

       2. <b>VLAN</b> <b>output</b> <b>processing</b>: This stage adjusts the packet  to  represent
          the  VLAN  in  the  correct  way  for the output port.  Its behavior
          varies based on the <b>vlan-mode</b> in the output port’s <b>Port</b> record:

             <b>trunk</b> <b>/</b> <b>native-tagged</b> <b>/</b> <b>native-untagged</b>
                    If the packet is in VLAN 0 (for  <b>native-untagged</b>,  if  the
                    packet  is  in  the  native VLAN) drops any 802.1Q header.
                    Otherwise, ensures that there is an 802.1Q  header  desig‐
                    nating the VLAN.

             <b>access</b> Remove any 802.1Q header that was present.

             <b>dot1q-tunnel</b>
                    Ensures  that  the  packet has an outer 802.1Q header with
                    the QinQ Ethertype and the specified configured  tag,  and
                    an inner 802.1Q header with the packet’s VLAN.

       3. <b>VLAN</b>  <b>priority</b>  <b>tag</b>  <b>processing</b>: If VLAN output processing discarded
          the 802.1Q headers, but priority tags are  enabled  with  <b>other_con‐</b>
          <b>fig:priority-tags</b>  in  the  output port’s <b>Port</b> record, then a prior‐
          ity-only tag is  added  (perhaps  only  if  the  priority  would  be
          nonzero, depending on the configuration).

       4. <b>Bond</b> <b>member</b> <b>choice</b>: If the output port is a bond, the code chooses a
          particular member.  This step is skipped for non-bonded ports.

          If  the  bond is configured to use LACP, but LACP negotiation is in‐
          complete, then normally the packet is  dropped.   The  exception  is
          that  if  fallback  to  active-backup  mode  is  enabled, the egress
          pipeline continues choosing a bond member as if  active-backup  mode
          was in use.

          For  active-backup  mode,  the  output  member is the active member.
          Other modes hash appropriate header fields and use the hash value to
          choose one of the enabled members.

       5. <b>Output</b>: The pipeline sends the packet to the output port.

   <b>The</b> <b>controller</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>controller</b>
              <b>controller:</b><u>max</u><b>_</b><u>len</u>
              <b>controller(</b><u>key</u><b>[=</b><u>value</u><b>],</b> <b>...)</b>


       Sends the packet and its metadata to an  OpenFlow  controller  or  con‐
       trollers  encapsulated in an OpenFlow <b>packet-in</b> message.  The supported
       options are:

          <b>max_len=</b><u>max</u><b>_</b><u>len</u>
                 Limit to <u>max</u><b>_</b><u>len</u> the number of bytes of the packet to send in
                 the <b>packet-in.</b>  A <u>max</u><b>_</b><u>len</u> of 0 prevents  any  of  the  packet
                 from  being  sent  (thus, only metadata is included).  By de‐
                 fault, the entire packet is sent, equivalent to a <u>max</u><b>_</b><u>len</u>  of
                 65535.   This  option  has  no  effect in Open vSwith 2.7 and
                 later: the entire packet will always be sent.

          <b>reason=</b><u>reason</u>
                 Specify <u>reason</u> as the reason for sending the message  in  the
                 <b>packet-in</b>.   The  supported reasons are <b>no_match</b>, <b>action</b>, <b>in‐</b>
                 <b>valid_ttl</b>, <b>action_set</b>, <b>group</b>, and  <b>packet_out</b>.   The  default
                 reason is <b>action</b>.

          <b>id=</b><u>controller</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>
                 Specify <u>controller</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>, a 16-bit integer, as the connection ID
                 of  the  OpenFlow  controller  or  controllers  to  which the
                 <b>packet-in</b> message should be sent.  The default is zero.  Zero
                 is also the default connection ID for each controller connec‐
                 tion, and a given controller  connection  will  only  have  a
                 nonzero connection ID if its controller uses the <b>NXT_SET_CON‐</b>
                 <b>TROLLER_ID</b> Open vSwitch extension to OpenFlow.

          <b>userdata=</b><u>hh</u><b>...</b>
                 Supplies the bytes represented as hex digits <u>hh</u> as additional
                 data  to  the  controller in the <b>packet-in</b> message.  Pairs of
                 hex digits may be separated by periods for readability.

          <b>pause</b>  Causes the switch to freeze the packet’s  trip  through  Open
                 vSwitch  flow  tables  and  serializes  that  state  into the
                 packet-in message as a <b>continuation,</b> an  additional  property
                 in the <b>NXT_PACKET_IN2</b> message.  The controller can later send
                 the continuation back to the switch in an <b>NXT_RESUME</b> message,
                 which  will  restart  the  packet’s  traversal from the point
                 where it was interrupted.   This  permits  an  OpenFlow  con‐
                 troller to interpose on a packet midway through processing in
                 Open vSwitch.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              All versions of OpenFlow and Open vSwitch support <b>controller</b> ac‐
              tion and its <b>max_len</b> option.  The <b>userdata</b> and <b>pause</b> options re‐
              quire  the Open vSwitch <b>NXAST_CONTROLLER2</b> extension action added
              in Open vSwitch 2.6. In the absence of these options, the <b>reason</b>
              (other than <b>reason=action</b>) and <b>controller_id</b> (option  than  <b>con‐</b>
              <b>troller_id=0</b>)  options require the Open vSwitch <b>NXAST_CONTROLLER</b>
              extension action added in Open vSwitch 1.6.

              Open vSwitch 2.7 and later is configured to not  buffer  packets
              for the packet-in event.  As a result, the full packet is always
              sent  to controllers.  This means that the <b>max_len</b> option has no
              effect on the <b>controller</b> action, and all  values  (even  0)  are
              equivalent to the default value of 65535.

   <b>The</b> <b>enqueue</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>enqueue(</b><u>port</u><b>,</b><u>queue</u><b>)</b>
              <b>enqueue:</b><u>port</u><b>:</b><u>queue</u>


       Enqueues the packet on the specified <u>queue</u> within port <u>port</u>.

       <u>port</u>  must  be  an OpenFlow port number or name as described under <u>Port</u>
       <u>Specifications</u> above.  <u>port</u> may be <b>in_port</b> or <b>local</b> but the other stan‐
       dard OpenFlow ports are not allowed.

       <u>queue</u> must be a number between 0 and  4294967294  (0xfffffffe),  inclu‐
       sive.   The  number of actually supported queues depends on the switch.
       Some OpenFlow implementations do not support queuing at all.   In  Open
       vSwitch,  the  supported queues vary depending on the operating system,
       datapath, and hardware in use.  Use the <b>QoS</b> and  <b>Queue</b>  tables  in  the
       Open vSwitch database to configure queuing on individual OpenFlow ports
       (see <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</b> for more information).

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Only  OpenFlow  1.0  supports  <b>enqueue</b>.   OpenFlow 1.1 added the
              <b>set_queue</b> action to use in its place along with <b>output</b>.

              Open vSwitch translates <b>enqueue</b> to a sequence of  three  actions
              in OpenFlow 1.1 or later: <b>set_queue:</b><u>queue</u><b>,output:</b><u>port</u><b>,pop_queue</b>.
              This  is  equivalent  in behavior as long as the flow table does
              not otherwise use <b>set_queue</b>, but it relies on the <b>pop_queue</b> Open
              vSwitch extension action.

   <b>The</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bundle_load</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>bundle(</b><u>fields</u><b>,</b><u>basis</u><b>,</b><u>algorithm</u><b>,ofport,members:</b><u>port</u><b>...)</b>
              <b>bundle_load(</b><u>fields</u><b>,</b><u>basis</u><b>,</b><u>algorithm</u><b>,ofport,</b><u>dst</u><b>,members:</b><u>port</u><b>...)</b>


       These actions choose a port (a <b>member</b>) from a comma-separated  OpenFlow
       <u>port</u>  list.   After  selecting  the port, <b>bundle</b> outputs to it, whereas
       <b>bundle_load</b> writes its port number to <u>dst</u>, which must be  a  16-bit  or
       wider  field or subfield in the syntax described under <u>Field</u> <u>Specifica‐</u>
       <u>tions</u> above.

       These actions hash a set of <u>fields</u> using <u>basis</u> as a universal hash  pa‐
       rameter,  then  apply  the  bundle link selection <u>algorithm</u> to choose a
       <u>port</u>.

       <u>fields</u> must be one of the following.  For the options with <b>symmetric</b> in
       the name, reversing source and destination addresses  yields  the  same
       hash:

          <b>eth_src</b>
                 Ethernet source address.

          <b>nw_src</b> IPv4 or IPv6 source address.

          <b>nw_dst</b> IPv4 or IPv6 destination address.

          <b>symmetric_l4</b>
                 Ethernet  source  and  destination, Ethernet type, VLAN ID or
                 IDs (if any), IPv4 or IPv6 source and destination, IP  proto‐
                 col, TCP or SCTP (but not UDP) source and destination.

          <b>symmetric_l3l4</b>
                 IPv4 or IPv6 source and destination, IP protocol, TCP or SCTP
                 (but not UDP) source and destination.

          <b>symmetric_l3l4+udp</b>
                 Like <b>symmetric_l3l4</b> but include UDP ports.

       <u>algorithm</u> must be one of the following:

          <b>active_backup</b>
                 Chooses the first live port listed in <b>members</b>.

          <b>hrw</b> <b>(Highest</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Weight)</b>
                 Computes  the  following,  considering only the live ports in
                 <b>members</b>:

                     for i in [1, n_members]:
                         weights[i] = hash(flow, i)
                     member = { i such that weights[i] &gt;= weights[j] for all j != i }

                 This algorithm is specified by RFC 2992.

       The algorithms take port liveness into account when selecting  members.
       The definition of whether a port is live is subject to change.  It cur‐
       rently  takes into account carrier status and link monitoring protocols
       such as BFD and CFM.  If none of the members is live, <b>bundle</b>  does  not
       output  the packet and <b>bundle_load</b> stores <b>OFPP_NONE</b> (65535) in the out‐
       put field.

       Example:  <b>bundle(eth_src,0,hrw,ofport,members:4,8)</b>  uses  an   Ethernet
       source  hash with basis 0, to select between OpenFlow ports 4 and 8 us‐
       ing the Highest Random Weight algorithm.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open vSwitch 1.2 introduced the <b>bundle</b> and <b>bundle_load</b>  OpenFlow
              extension actions.

   <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>group:</b><u>group</u>


       Outputs  the packet to the OpenFlow group <u>group</u>, which must be a number
       in the range 0 to 4294967040 (0xffffff00).  The  group  must  exist  or
       Open  vSwitch  will  refuse  to add the flow.  When a group is deleted,
       Open vSwitch also deletes all of the flows that output to it.

       Groups contain action sets, whose semantics are described above in  the
       section <u>Action</u> <u>Sets</u>.  The semantics of action sets can be surprising to
       users  who  expect action list semantics, since action sets reorder and
       sometimes ignore actions.

       A <b>group</b> action usually executes the action set or sets in one  or  more
       group  buckets.   Open  vSwitch saves the packet and metadata before it
       executes each bucket, and then restores it  afterward.   Thus,  when  a
       group  executes  more than one bucket, this means that each bucket exe‐
       cutes on the same packet and metadata.   Moreover,  regardless  of  the
       number of buckets executed, the packet and metadata are the same before
       and after executing the group.

       Sometimes  saving and restoring the packet and metadata can be undesir‐
       able.  In these situations, workarounds  are  possible.   For  example,
       consider  a pipeline design in which a <b>select</b> group bucket is to commu‐
       nicate to a later stage of processing a value based on which bucket was
       selected.  An obvious design would be for the bucket to communicate the
       value via <b>set_field</b> on a register.  This does not work  because  regis‐
       ters  are part of the metadata that <b>group</b> saves and restores.  The fol‐
       lowing alternative bucket designs do work:

          • Recursively invoke the rest of the pipeline with <b>resubmit</b>.

          • Use <b>resubmit</b> into a table that uses <b>push</b> to put the value  on  the
            stack  for  the  caller to <b>pop</b> off.  This works because <b>group</b> pre‐
            serves only packet data and metadata, not the stack.

            (This design requires indirection through <b>resubmit</b> because actions
            sets may not contain <b>push</b> or <b>pop</b> actions.)

       An <b>exit</b> action within a group bucket terminates only execution of  that
       bucket, not other buckets or the overall pipeline.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow  1.1 introduced <b>group</b>.  Open vSwitch 2.6 and later also
              supports <b>group</b> as an extension to OpenFlow 1.0.

<b>ENCAPSULATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DECAPSULATION</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
   <b>The</b> <b>strip_vlan</b> <b>and</b> <b>pop</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>strip_vlan</b>
              <b>pop_vlan</b>


       Removes the outermost VLAN tag, if any, from the packet.

       The two names for this action are synonyms with no semantic difference.
       The OpenFlow 1.0 specification uses the name <b>strip_vlan</b> and later  ver‐
       sions use <b>pop_vlan</b>, but OVS accepts either name regardless of version.

       In OpenFlow 1.1 and later, consistency rules allow <b>strip_vlan</b> only in a
       flow  that matches only packets with a VLAN tag (or following an action
       that pushes a VLAN  tag,  such  as  <b>push_vlan</b>).   See  <u>Inconsistencies</u>,
       above, for more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              All versions of OpenFlow and Open vSwitch support this action.

   <b>The</b> <b>push_vlan</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>push_vlan:</b><u>ethertype</u>


       Pushes  a  new  outermost  VLAN  onto the packet.  Uses TPID <u>ethertype</u>,
       which must be <b>0x8100</b> for an 802.1Q C-tag or <b>0x88a8</b> for a 802.1ad S-tag.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.1 and later supports this action.  Open  vSwitch  2.8
              added  support  for  multiple  VLAN tags (with a limit of 2) and
              802.1ad S-tags.

   <b>The</b> <b>push_mpls</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>push_mpls:</b><u>ethertype</u>


       Pushes a new outermost MPLS label stack entry (LSE) onto the packet and
       changes the packet’s Ethertype  to  <u>ethertype</u>,  which  must  be  either
       <b>B0x8847</b>  or <b>0x8848</b>.  If the packet did not already contain any MPLS la‐
       bels, initializes the new LSE as:

          <b>Label</b>  2, if the packet contains IPv6, 0 otherwise.

          <b>TC</b>     The low 3 bits of the packet’s DSCP value, or 0 if the packet
                 is not IP.

          <b>TTL</b>    Copied from the IP TTL, or 64 if the packet is not IP.

       If the packet did already contain an MPLS label,  initializes  the  new
       outermost label as a copy of the existing outermost label.

       OVS currently supports at most 3 MPLS labels.

       This action applies only to Ethernet packets.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open vSwitch 1.11 introduced support for MPLS.  OpenFlow 1.1 and
              later  support  <b>push_mpls</b>.  Open vSwitch implements <b>push_mpls</b> as
              an extension to OpenFlow 1.0.

   <b>The</b> <b>pop_mpls</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>pop_mpls:</b><u>ethertype</u>


       Strips the outermost MPLS label stack entry and  changes  the  packet’s
       Ethertype  to  <u>ethertype</u>.  This action applies only to Ethernet packets
       with at least one MPLS label.  If there is more than  one  MPLS  label,
       then <u>ethertype</u> should be an MPLS Ethertype (<b>B0x8847</b> or <b>0x8848</b>).

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open vSwitch 1.11 introduced support for MPLS.  OpenFlow 1.1 and
              later  support <b>pop_mpls</b>.  Open vSwitch implements <b>pop_mpls</b> as an
              extension to OpenFlow 1.0.

   <b>The</b> <b>encap</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>encap(nsh([md_type=</b><u>md</u><b>_</b><u>type</u><b>],</b> <b>[tlv(</b><u>class</u>,<u>type</u>,<u>value</u><b>)]...))</b>
              <b>encap(ethernet)</b>
              <b>encap(mpls)</b>
              <b>encap(mpls_mc)</b>


       The <b>encap</b> action encapsulates a packet with a specified header.  It has
       variants for different kinds of encapsulation.

       The <b>encap(nsh(...))</b> variant encapsulates an Ethernet  frame  with  NSH.
       The  <u>md</u><b>_</b><u>type</u>  may  be <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> for metadata type 1 or 2, defaulting to 1.
       For metadata type 2, TLVs may be specified with <u>class</u> as a 16-bit hexa‐
       decimal integer beginning with <b>0x</b>, <u>type</u> as an  8-bit  decimal  integer,
       and <u>value</u> a sequence of pairs of hex digits beginning with <b>0x</b>.  For ex‐
       ample:

          <b>encap(nsh(md_type=1))</b>
                 Encapsulates the packet with an NSH header with metadata type
                 1.

          <b>encap(nsh(md_type=2,tlv(0x1000,10,0x12345678)))</b>
                 Encapsulates the packet with an NSH header, NSH metadata type
                 2,  and an NSH TLV with class 0x1000, type 10, and the 4-byte
                 value 0x12345678.

       The <b>encap(ethernet)</b> variant encapsulate a bare L3 packet in an Ethernet
       frame.  The Ethernet type is initialized to the L3 packet’s type,  e.g.
       0x0800  if  the L3 packet is IPv4.  The Ethernet source and destination
       are initially zeroed.

       The <b>encap(mpls)</b> variant adds a MPLS header at the start of the  packet.
       When  encap(ethernet)  is  applied  after this action, the ethertype of
       ethernet header will be populated with MPLS unicast ethertype (<b>0x8847</b>).

       The <b>encap(mpls_mc)</b> variant adds a MPLS  header  at  the  start  of  the
       packet.   When encap(ethernet) is applied after this action, the ether‐
       type of ethernet header will be populated with MPLS multicast ethertype
       (<b>0x8848</b>).

       <b>Conformance</b>
              This action is an Open vSwitch extension  to  OpenFlow  1.3  and
              later, introduced in Open vSwitch 2.8.

              The MPLS support for this action is added in Open vSwitch 2.17.

   <b>The</b> <b>decap</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>decap</b>
              <b>decap(packet_type(ns=</b><u>namespace,</u><b>type=</b><u>type</u><b>))</b>


       Removes an outermost encapsulation from the packet:

          • If  the packet is an Ethernet packet, removes the Ethernet header,
            which changes the packet into a bare L3 packet.  If the packet has
            VLAN tags, raises an unsupported packet type error (see <u>Error</u> <u>Han‐</u>
            <u>dling</u>, above).

          • Otherwise, if the packet is an NSH packet, removes the NSH header,
            revealing the inner packet.  Open vSwitch supports Ethernet, IPv4,
            IPv6, and NSH inner packet types.  Other types  raise  unsupported
            packet type errors.

          • Otherwise, if the packet is encapsulated inside a MPLS header, re‐
            moves the MPLS header and classifies the inner packet as mentioned
            in  the  packet type argument of the decap.  The <u>packet</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> field
            specifies the type of the packet in the format specified in  Open‐
            Flow  1.5  chapter  <u>7.2.3.11</u>  <u>Packet</u>  <u>Type</u> <u>Match</u> <u>Field</u>.  The inner
            packet will be incorrectly classified, if the inner packet is dif‐
            ferent from mentioned in the <u>packet</u><b>_</b><u>type</u> field.

          • Otherwise, raises an unsupported packet type error.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              This action is an Open vSwitch extension  to  OpenFlow  1.3  and
              later, introduced in Open vSwitch 2.8.

              The MPLS support for this action is added in Open vSwitch 2.17.

<b>FIELD</b> <b>MODIFICATION</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
       These actions modify packet data and metadata fields.

   <b>The</b> <b>set_field</b> <b>and</b> <b>load</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>set_field:</b><u>value</u><b>[/</b><u>mask</u><b>]-&gt;</b><u>dst</u>
              <b>load:</b><u>value</u><b>-&gt;</b><u>dst</u>


       These  actions  loads  a literal value into a field or part of a field.
       The <b>set_field</b> action takes <u>value</u> in the customary syntax for field <u>dst</u>,
       e.g. <b>00:11:22:33:44:55</b> for an Ethernet address, and <u>dst</u> as the  field’s
       name.  The optional <u>mask</u> allows part of a field to be set.

       The <b>load</b> action takes <u>value</u> as an integer value (in decimal or prefixed
       by <b>0x</b> for hexadecimal) and <u>dst</u> as a field or subfield in the syntax de‐
       scribed under <u>Field</u> <u>Specifications</u> above.

       The following all set the Ethernet source address to 00:11:22:33:44:55:

          • <b>set_field:00:11:22:33:44:55-&gt;eth_src</b>

          • <b>load:0x001122334455-&gt;eth_src</b>

          • <b>load:0x001122334455-&gt;OXM_OF_ETH_SRC[]</b>

       The following all set the multicast bit in the Ethernet destination ad‐
       dress:

          • <b>set_field:01:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00-&gt;eth_dst</b>

          • <b>load:1-&gt;eth_dst[40]</b>

       Open  vSwitch  prohibits  a  <b>set_field</b>  or <b>load</b> action whose <u>dst</u> is not
       guaranteed to be part of the packet; for example, <b>set_field</b>  of  <b>nw_dst</b>
       is only allowed in a flow that matches on Ethernet type 0x800.  In some
       cases,  such  as  in an action set, Open vSwitch can’t statically check
       that <u>dst</u> is part of the packet, and in that case if it is not then Open
       vSwitch treats the action as a no-op.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open vSwitch 1.1 introduced <b>NXAST_REG_LOAD</b>  as  a  extension  to
              OpenFlow  1.0  and used <b>load</b> to express it.  Later, OpenFlow 1.2
              introduced a standard <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b> action that was restricted
              to loading  entire  fields,  so  Open  vSwitch  added  the  form
              <b>set_field</b>  with  this  restriction.   OpenFlow  1.5 extended <b>OF‐</b>
              <b>PAT_SET_FIELD</b> to the point that it  became  a  superset  of  <b>NX‐</b>
              <b>AST_REG_LOAD</b>.   Open  vSwitch translates either syntax as neces‐
              sary for the OpenFlow version in use: in OpenFlow 1.0  and  1.1,
              <b>NXAST_REG_LOAD</b>;  in  OpenFlow  1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, <b>NXAST_REG_LOAD</b>
              for <b>load</b> or for loading a subfield,  <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b>  otherwise;
              and OpenFlow 1.5 and later, <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>move:</b><u>src</u><b>-&gt;</b><u>dst</u>


       Copies  the  named bits from field or subfield <u>src</u> to field or subfield
       <u>dst</u>.  <u>src</u> and <u>dst</u> should fields or subfields in  the  syntax  described
       under  <u>Field</u>  <u>Specifications</u>  above.   The two fields or subfields must
       have the same width.

       Examples:

          • <b>move:reg0[0..5]-&gt;reg1[26..31]</b>  copies  the  six  bits  numbered  0
            through 5 in register 0 into bits 26 through 31 of register 1.

          • <b>move:reg0[0..15]-&gt;vlan_tci</b> copies the least significant 16 bits of
            register 0 into the VLAN TCI field.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              In  OpenFlow  1.0  through  1.4,  <b>move</b>  ordinarily  uses an Open
              vSwitch extension to OpenFlow.  In OpenFlow 1.5, <b>move</b>  uses  the
              OpenFlow 1.5 standard <b>OFPAT_COPY_FIELD</b> action.  The ONF has also
              made <b>OFPAT_COPY_FIELD</b> available as an extension to OpenFlow 1.3.
              Open  vSwitch  2.4 and later understands this extension and uses
              it if a controller uses it, but for backward compatibility  with

              <b>mod_dl_src:</b><u>mac</u>
              <b>mod_dl_dst:</b><u>mac</u>


       Sets  the Ethernet source or destination address, respectively, to <u>mac</u>,
       which should be expressed in the form <b>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</b>.

       For L3-only packets, that is, those that lack an Ethernet header,  this

              OpenFlow  1.0  and  1.1  have specialized actions for these pur‐
              poses.  OpenFlow 1.2 and later do not, so  Open  vSwitch  trans‐
              lates them to appropriate <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b> actions for those ver‐

              <b>mod_nw_dst:</b><u>ip</u>


       Sets the IPv4 source or destination address, respectively, to <u>ip</u>, which
       should be expressed in the form <b>w.x.y.z</b>.

       In  OpenFlow  1.1 and later, consistency rules allow these actions only
       in a flow that matches only packets that contain  an  IPv4  header  (or
       following  an  action  that adds an IPv4 header, e.g. <b>pop_mpls:0x0800</b>).

              <b>mod_nw_tos:</b><u>tos</u>
              <b>mod_nw_ecn:</b><u>ecn</u>


       The <b>mod_nw_tos</b> action sets the DSCP bits in the IPv4 ToS/DSCP  or  IPv6
       traffic class field to <u>tos</u>, which must be a multiple of 4 between 0 and
       255.  This action does not modify the two least significant bits of the
       ToS field (the ECN bits).

       The <b>mod_nw_ecn</b> action sets the ECN bits in the IPv4 ToS or IPv6 traffic
       class  field  to <u>ecn</u>, which must be a value between 0 and 3, inclusive.
       This action does not modify the six most significant bits of the  field
       (the DSCP bits).

       In  OpenFlow  1.1 and later, consistency rules allow these actions only
       in a flow that matches only packets that contain an IPv4 or IPv6 header
       (or following an action that adds such a header).  See <u>Inconsistencies</u>,
       above, for more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.0 has a <b>mod_nw_tos</b> action but not  <b>mod_nw_ecn</b>.   Open
              vSwitch  implements  the  latter in OpenFlow 1.0 as an extension
              using <b>NXAST_REG_LOAD</b>.  OpenFlow 1.1 has specialized actions  for
              these  purposes.  OpenFlow 1.2 and later do not, so Open vSwitch
              translates them to appropriate <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b> actions for those
              versions.

              <b>mod_tp_src:</b><u>port</u>
              <b>mod_tp_dst:</b><u>port</u>


       Sets the TCP or UDP or SCTP source or destination  port,  respectively,
       to <u>port</u>.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

       In  OpenFlow  1.1 and later, consistency rules allow these actions only
       in a flow that matches only packets that contain a TCP or UDP  or  SCTP
       header.  See <u>Inconsistencies</u>, above, for more information.

   <b>The</b> <b>dec_ttl</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>dec_ttl</b>
              <b>dec_ttl(</b><u>id1</u><b>[,</b><u>id2</u><b>[,</b> <b>...]])</b>


       Decrement  TTL  of IPv4 packet or hop limit of IPv6 packet.  If the TTL
       or hop limit is initially 0 or  1,  no  decrement  occurs,  as  packets
       reaching  TTL  zero  must  be  rejected.  Instead, Open vSwitch sends a
       <b>packet-in</b> message with reason code <b>OFPR_INVALID_TTL</b> to  each  connected
       controller that has enabled receiving such messages, and stops process‐
       ing  the  current  set of actions.  (However, if the current set of ac‐
       tions was reached through <b>resubmit</b>, the remaining actions in outer lev‐
       els resume processing.)

       As an Open vSwitch extension to  OpenFlow,  this  action  supports  the
       ability  to  specify  a list of controller IDs.  Open vSwitch will only
       send the message to controllers with the given ID or  IDs.   Specifying
       no list is equivalent to specifying a single controller ID of zero.

       In  OpenFlow  1.1 and later, consistency rules allow these actions only
       in a flow that matches only  packets  that  contain  an  IPv4  or  IPv6
       header.  See <u>Inconsistencies</u>, above, for more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              All versions of OpenFlow and Open vSwitch support this action.

   <b>The</b> <b>set_mpls_label,</b> <b>set_mpls_tc,</b> <b>and</b> <b>set_mpls_ttl</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>set_mpls_label:</b><u>label</u>
              <b>set_mpls_tc:</b><u>tc</u>
              <b>set_mpls_ttl:</b><u>ttl</u>


       The <b>set_mpls_label</b> action sets the label of the packet’s outer MPLS la‐
       bel stack entry.  <u>label</u> should be a 20-bit value that is decimal by de‐
       fault; use a <b>0x</b> prefix to specify the value in hexadecimal.

       The  <b>set_mpls_tc</b>  action  sets  the traffic class of the packet’s outer
       MPLS label stack entry.  <u>tc</u> should be in the range 0 to 7, inclusive.

       The <b>set_mpls_ttl</b> action sets the TTL of the packet’s outer  MPLS  label
       stack  entry.  <u>ttl</u> should be in the range 0 to 255 inclusive.  In Open‐
       Flow 1.1 and later, consistency rules allow these  actions  only  in  a
       flow that matches only packets that contain an MPLS label (or following
       an  action  that  adds  an  MPLS  label,  e.g.  <b>push_mpls:0x8847</b>).  See
       <u>Inconsistencies</u>, above, for more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.0 does not support MPLS, but Open vSwitch  implements
              these  actions  as extensions.  OpenFlow 1.1 has specialized ac‐
              tions for these purposes.  OpenFlow 1.2 and  later  do  not,  so
              Open  vSwitch translates them to appropriate <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b> ac‐
              tions for those versions,

   <b>The</b> <b>dec_mpls_ttl</b> <b>and</b> <b>dec_nsh_ttl</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>dec_mpls_ttl</b>
              <b>dec_nsh_ttl</b>


       These actions decrement the TTL of the packet’s outer MPLS label  stack
       entry or its NSH header, respectively.  If the TTL is initially 0 or 1,
       no  decrement  occurs.  Instead, Open vSwitch sends a <b>packet-in</b> message
       with reason code <b>BOFPR_INVALID_TTL</b> to OpenFlow controllers with  ID  0,
       if  it  has  enabled receiving them.  Processing the current set of ac‐
       tions then stops.  (However, if the current set of actions was  reached
       through <b>resubmit</b>, remaining actions in outer levels resume processing.)

       In OpenFlow 1.1 and later, consistency rules allow this actions only in
       a  flow  that matches only packets that contain an MPLS label or an NSH
       header, respectively.  See <u>Inconsistencies</u>, above,  for  more  informa‐
       tion.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open vSwitch 1.11 introduced support for MPLS.  OpenFlow 1.1 and
              later    support    <b>dec_mpls_ttl</b>.    Open   vSwitch   implements
              <b>dec_mpls_ttl</b> as an extension to OpenFlow 1.0.

              Open vSwitch 2.8 introduced support for NSH,  although  the  NSH
              draft  changed  after  release so that only Open vSwitch 2.9 and
              later  conform  to  the  final  protocol   specification.    The
              <b>dec_nsh_ttl</b> action and NSH support in general is an Open vSwitch
              extension not supported by any version of OpenFlow.

   <b>The</b> <b>check_pkt_larger</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>check_pkt_larger(</b><u>pkt</u><b>_</b><u>len</u><b>)-&gt;</b><u>dst</u>


       Checks  if  the  packet is larger than the specified length in <u>pkt</u><b>_</b><u>len</u>.
       If so, stores 1 in <u>dst</u>, which should be a 1-bit field; if  not,  stores
       0.

       The packet length to check against the argument <u>pkt</u><b>_</b><u>len</u> includes the L2
       header and L2 payload of the packet, but not the VLAN tag (if present).

       Examples:

          • <b>check_pkt_larger(1500)-&gt;reg0[0]</b>

          • <b>check_pkt_larger(8000)-&gt;reg9[10]</b>

       This action was added in Open vSwitch 2.12.

   <b>The</b> <b>delete_field</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>delete_field:</b><u>field</u>


       The  <b>delete_field</b>  action deletes a <u>field</u> in the syntax described under
       <u>Field</u> <u>Specifications</u> above.  Currently, only  the  <b>tun_metadata</b>  fields
       are supported.

       This action was added in Open vSwitch 2.14.

<b>METADATA</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
   <b>The</b> <b>set_tunnel</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>set_tunnel:</b><u>id</u>
              <b>set_tunnel64:</b><u>id</u>


       Many kinds of tunnels support a tunnel ID, e.g. VXLAN and Geneve have a
       24-bit  VNI,  and GRE has an optional 32-bit key.  This action sets the
       value used for tunnel ID in such tunneled packets, although whether  it
       is  used for a particular tunnel depends on the tunnel’s configuration.
       See the tunnel ID documentation in <b>ovs-fields(7)</b> for more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              These actions are OpenFlow extensions.   <b>set_tunnel</b>  was  intro‐
              duced  in Open vSwitch 1.0.  <b>set_tunnel64</b>, which is needed if <u>id</u>
              is wider than 32 bits, was added in Open vSwitch 1.1.  Both  ac‐
              tions  always set the entire tunnel ID field.  Open vSwitch sup‐
              ports these actions in all versions of OpenFlow, but in OpenFlow
              1.2 and later it translates them to an appropriate  standardized
              <b>OFPAT_SET_FIELD</b> action.

   <b>The</b> <b>set_queue</b> <b>and</b> <b>pop_queue</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>set_queue:</b><u>queue</u>
              <b>pop_queue</b>


       The <b>set_queue</b> action sets the queue ID to be used for subsequent output
       actions  to  <u>queue</u>, which must be a 32-bit integer.  The range of mean‐
       ingful values of <u>queue</u>, and their meanings,  varies  greatly  from  one
       OpenFlow  implementation  to another.  Even within a single implementa‐
       tion, there is no guarantee that  all  OpenFlow  ports  have  the  same
       queues  configured  or that all OpenFlow ports in an implementation can
       be configured the same way queue-wise.  For more information,  see  the
       documentation for the output queue field in <b>ovs-fields(7)</b>.

       The  <b>pop_queue</b>  restores  the  output queue to the default that was set
       when the packet entered the switch (generally 0).

       Four   billion   queues   ought    to    be    enough    for    anyone:
       <u>https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/openflow-spec/2009-August/000394.html</u>

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.1 introduced the <b>set_queue</b> action.  Open vSwitch also
              supports it as an extension in OpenFlow 1.0.

              The <b>pop_queue</b> action is an Open vSwitch extension.

<b>FIREWALLING</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
       Open  vSwitch is often used to implement a firewall.  The preferred way
       to implement a firewall is <b>connection</b> <b>tracking,</b> that is, to keep  track
       of  the connection state of individual TCP sessions.  The <b>ct</b> action de‐
       scribed in this section, added in Open vSwitch 2.5, implements  connec‐
       tion  tracking.   For new deployments, it is the recommended way to im‐
       plement firewalling with Open vSwitch.

       Before <b>ct</b> was added, Open vSwitch did not  have  built-in  support  for
       connection tracking.  Instead, Open vSwitch supported the <b>learn</b> action,
       which allows a received packet to add a flow to an OpenFlow flow table.
       This  could  be used to implement a primitive form of connection track‐
       ing: packets passing through the firewall in one direction could create
       flows that allowed response packets back through the  firewall  in  the
       other direction.  The additional <b>fin_timeout</b> action allowed the learned
       flows to expire quickly after TCP session termination.

   <b>The</b> <b>ct</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>ct([</b><u>argument</u><b>]...)</b>
              <b>ct(commit[,</b><u>argument</u><b>]...)</b>


       The  action has two modes of operation, distinguished by whether <b>commit</b>
       is present.  The following arguments may be present in either mode:

          <b>zone=</b><u>value</u>
                 A zone is a 16-bit id that isolates connections into separate
                 domains, allowing overlapping network addresses in  different
                 zones.  If a zone is not provided, then the default is 0. The
                 <u>value</u>  may be specified either as a 16-bit integer literal or
                 a field or subfield in the syntax described under <u>Field</u> <u>Spec‐</u>
                 <u>ifications</u> above.

       Without <b>commit</b>, this action sends the  packet  through  the  connection
       tracker.   The  connection tracker keeps track of the state of TCP con‐
       nections for packets passed through it.  For each packet through a con‐
       nection, it checks that it satisfies TCP  invariants  and  signals  the
       connection  state  to  later actions using the <b>ct_state</b> metadata field,
       which is documented in <b>ovs-fields(7)</b>.

       In this form, <b>ct</b> forks the OpenFlow pipeline:

          • In one fork, <b>ct</b> passes the packet to the connection tracker.   Af‐
            terward,  it  reinjects the packet into the OpenFlow pipeline with
            the connection tracking fields initialized.  The <b>ct_state</b> field is
            initialized with connection state and <b>ct_zone</b>  to  the  connection
            tracking  zone  specified on the <b>zone</b> argument.  If the connection
            is one that is already tracked, <b>ct_mark</b> and <b>ct_label</b> to its exist‐
            ing mark and label, respectively; otherwise they are  zeroed.   In
            addition,    <b>ct_nw_proto</b>,   <b>ct_nw_src</b>,   <b>ct_nw_dst</b>,   <b>ct_ipv6_src</b>,
            <b>ct_ipv6_dst</b>, <b>ct_tp_src</b>, and <b>ct_tp_dst</b>  are  initialized  appropri‐
            ately for the original direction connection.  See the <b>resubmit</b> ac‐
            tion for a way to search the flow table with the connection track‐
            ing  original  direction  fields  swapped  with the packet 5-tuple
            fields.  See <b>ovs-fields(7)</b> for details on the connection  tracking
            fields.

          • In  the  other fork, the original instance of the packet continues
            independent processing following  the  <b>ct</b>  action.   The  <b>ct_state</b>
            field and other connection tracking metadata are cleared.

       Without <b>commit</b>, the <b>ct</b> action accepts the following arguments:

          <b>table=</b><u>table</u>
                 Sets  the OpenFlow table where the packet is reinjected.  The
                 <u>table</u> must be a number between 0 and 254 inclusive, or a  ta‐
                 ble’s  name.   If  <u>table</u> is not specified, then the packet is
                 not reinjected.

          <b>nat</b>

          <b>nat(</b><u>type</u><b>=</b><u>addrs</u><b>[:</b><u>ports</u><b>][,</b><u>flag</u><b>]...)</b>
                 Specify address and port translation for the connection being
                 tracked.  The <u>type</u>  must  be  <b>src</b>,  for  source  address/port
                 translation  (SNAT),  or  <b>dst</b>,  for  destination address/port
                 translation (DNAT).  Setting up address translation for a new
                 connection takes effect only if the connection is later  com‐
                 mitted with <b>ct(commit</b> <b>...)</b>.

                 The <b>src</b> and <b>dst</b> options take the following arguments:

                     <u>addrs</u>  The  IP  address  <b>addr</b>  or  range <b>addr1-addr2</b> from
                            which the translated address should  be  selected.
                            If  only  one  address is given, then that address
                            will always be selected, otherwise the address se‐
                            lection can be informed by the optional persistent
                            flag as described below.  Either IPv4 or IPv6  ad‐
                            dresses  can  be provided, but both addresses must
                            be of the same type, and the datapath behavior  is
                            undefined  in case of providing IPv4 address range
                            for an IPv6 packet, or IPv6 address range  for  an
                            IPv4  packet.   IPv6  addresses  must be bracketed
                            with <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> if a port range is also given.

                     <u>ports</u>  The L4 <b>port</b> or range <b>port1-port2</b>  from  which  the
                            translated  port  should  be selected. When a port
                            range is specified, fallback  to  ephemeral  ports
                            does  not  happen, else, it will.  The port number
                            selection can be informed by the  optional  <b>random</b>
                            and  <b>hash</b>  flags  described  below.  The userspace
                            datapath only supports the <b>hash</b> behavior.

                 The optional <u>flags</u> are:

                     <b>random</b> The selection of the port  from  the  given  range
                            should  be done using a fresh random number.  This
                            flag is mutually exclusive with <b>hash</b>.

                     <b>hash</b>   The selection of the port  from  the  given  range
                            should  be  done using a datapath specific hash of
                            the  packet’s  IP   addresses   and   the   other,
                            non-mapped port number.  This flag is mutually ex‐
                            clusive with <b>random</b>.

                     <b>persistent</b>
                            The  selection  of  the  IP address from the given
                            range should be done so that the same mapping  can
                            be provided after the system restarts.

                 If  <b>alg</b>  is  specified for the committing <b>ct</b> action that also
                 includes <b>nat</b> with a <b>src</b> or <b>dst</b> attribute, then  the  datapath
                 tries to set up the helper to be NAT-aware.  This functional‐
                 ity  is  datapath  specific  and  may not be supported by all
                 datapaths.

                 A <b>bare</b> <b>nat</b> argument with no options will only  translate  the
                 packet being processed in the way the connection has been set
                 up  with  an earlier, committed <b>ct</b> action.  A <b>nat</b> action with
                 <b>src</b> or <b>dst</b>, when applied to a packet belonging to  an  estab‐
                 lished  (rather than new) connection, will behave the same as
                 a bare <b>nat</b>.

                 For SNAT, there is a special case when the <b>src</b> IP address  is
                 configured  as all 0’s, i.e., <b>nat(src=0.0.0.0)</b>. In this case,
                 when a source port collision is detected during  the  commit,
                 the  source  port will be translated to an ephemeral port. If
                 there is no collision, no SNAT is performed.

                 Open vSwitch 2.6 introduced <b>nat</b>.  Linux 4.6 was the  earliest
                 upstream kernel that implemented <b>ct</b> support for <b>nat</b>.

       With  <b>commit</b>, the connection tracker commits the connection to the con‐
       nection tracking module.  The <b>commit</b> flag should only be used from  the
       pipeline within the first fork of <b>ct</b> without <b>commit</b>.  Information about
       the  connection  is  stored  beyond  the  lifetime of the packet in the
       pipeline.  Some <b>ct_state</b> flags are only available for committed connec‐
       tions.

       The following options are available only with <b>commit</b>:

          <b>force</b>  A committed connection always has the directionality  of  the
                 packet  that  caused  the  connection  to be committed in the
                 first place.  This is the <b>original</b> <b>direction</b> of  the  connec‐
                 tion,  and the opposite direction is the <b>reply</b> <b>direction</b>.  If
                 a connection is already committed, but it is in the wrong di‐
                 rection, <b>force</b> effectively terminates the existing connection
                 and starts a new one in the current direction.  This flag has
                 no effect if the original direction of the connection is  al‐
                 ready the same as that of the current packet.

          <b>exec(</b><u>action</u><b>...)</b>
                 Perform  each  <u>action</u> within the context of connection track‐
                 ing.  Only actions  which  modify  the  <b>ct_mark</b>  or  <b>ct_label</b>
                 fields  are accepted within <b>exec</b> action, and these fields may
                 only be modified with this option. For example:

                 <b>set_field:</b><u>value</u><b>[/</b><u>mask</u><b>]-&gt;ct_mark</b>
                        Store a 32-bit metadata  value  with  the  connection.
                        Subsequent lookups for packets in this connection will
                        populate  <b>ct_mark</b>  when the packet is sent to the con‐
                        nection tracker with the table specified.

                 <b>set_field:</b><u>value</u><b>[/</b><u>mask</u><b>]-&gt;ct_label</b>
                        Store a 128-bit metadata value  with  the  connection.
                        Subsequent lookups for packets in this connection will
                        populate  <b>ct_label</b> when the packet is sent to the con‐
                        nection tracker with the table specified.

          <b>alg=</b><u>alg</u>
                 Specify application layer gateway <u>alg</u> to track specific  con‐
                 nection  types.   If  subsequent related connections are sent
                 through the <b>ct</b> action, then the  <b>rel</b>  flag  in  the  <b>ct_state</b>
                 field will be set.  Supported types include:

                 <b>ftp</b>    Look for negotiation of FTP data connections.  Specify
                        this  option for FTP control connections to detect re‐
                        lated data connections and populate the <b>rel</b>  flag  for
                        the data connections.

                 <b>tftp</b>   Look  for negotiation of TFTP data connections.  Spec‐
                        ify this option for TFTP control connections to detect
                        related data connections and populate the <b>rel</b> flag for
                        the data connections.

                 Related connections inherit <b>ct_mark</b> from that stored with the
                 original  connection  (i.e.   the   connection   created   by
                 <b>ct(alg=...)</b>.

       With  the Linux datapath, global sysctl options affect <b>ct</b> behavior.  In
       particular, if <b>net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_helper</b> is enabled,  which  it
       is  by  default until Linux 4.7, then application layer gateway helpers
       may be executed even if <u>alg</u> is not specified.   For  security  reasons,
       the  netfilter  team recommends users disable this option.  For further
       details, please see <u>http://www.netfilter.org/news.html#2012-04-03</u> .

       The <b>ct</b> action may be used as a primitive to  construct  stateful  fire‐
       walls by selectively committing some traffic, then matching <b>ct_state</b> to
       allow  established connections while denying new connections.  The fol‐
       lowing flows provide an example of how to implement a  simple  firewall
       that  allows new connections from port 1 to port 2, and only allows es‐
       tablished connections to send traffic from port 2 to port 1:

          table=0,priority=1,action=drop
          table=0,priority=10,arp,action=normal
          table=0,priority=100,ip,ct_state=-trk,action=ct(table=1)
          table=1,in_port=1,ip,ct_state=+trk+new,action=ct(commit),2
          table=1,in_port=1,ip,ct_state=+trk+est,action=2
          table=1,in_port=2,ip,ct_state=+trk+new,action=drop
          table=1,in_port=2,ip,ct_state=+trk+est,action=1

       If <b>ct</b> is executed on IPv4 (or IPv6) fragments, then the message is  im‐
       plicitly  reassembled  before sending to the connection tracker and re‐
       fragmented upon output, to the original maximum received fragment size.
       Reassembly occurs within the context of the zone, meaning that IP frag‐
       ments in different zones are not assembled together.  Pipeline process‐
       ing for the initial fragments is halted.  When the  final  fragment  is
       received,  the  message  is assembled and pipeline processing continues
       for that flow.  Packet ordering is not guaranteed by IP  protocols,  so
       it  is  not  possible to determine which IP fragment will cause message
       reassembly (and therefore continue pipeline processing). As such, it is
       strongly recommended that multiple flows should not execute <b>ct</b>  to  re‐
       assemble fragments from the same IP message.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              The  <b>ct</b>  action was introduced in Open vSwitch 2.5.  Some of its
              features were introduced later, noted individually above.

   <b>The</b> <b>ct_clear</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>ct_clear</b>


       Clears connection tracking  state  from  the  flow,  zeroing  <b>ct_state</b>,
       <b>ct_zone</b>, <b>ct_mark</b>, and <b>ct_label</b>.

       This action was introduced in Open vSwitch 2.7.

   <b>The</b> <b>learn</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>learn(</b><u>argument</u><b>...)</b>


       The  <b>learn</b> action adds or modifies a flow in an OpenFlow table, similar
       to <b>ovs-ofctl</b> <b>--strict</b>  <b>mod-flows</b>.   The  arguments  specify  the  match
       fields,  actions, and other properties of the flow to be added or modi‐
       fied.

       Match fields for the new flow are specified as follows.  At  least  one
       match field should ordinarily be specified:

          <u>field</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
                 Specifies that <u>field</u>, in the new flow, must match the literal
                 <u>value</u>,  e.g.  <b>dl_type=0x800</b>.  Shorthand match syntax, such as
                 <b>ip</b> in place of <b>dl_type=0x800</b>, is not supported.

          <u>field</u><b>=</b><u>src</u>
                 Specifies that <u>field</u> in the new flow  must  match  <u>src</u>  taken
                 from  the  packet  currently  being  processed.  For example,
                 <b>udp_dst=udp_src</b>, applied to a UDP packet with source port 53,
                 creates a flow which matches <b>udp_dst=53</b>.  <u>field</u> and <u>src</u>  must
                 have the same width.

          <u>field</u>  Shorthand  for  the  previous form when <u>field</u> and <u>src</u> are the
                 same.  For example, <b>udp_dst</b>, applied to  a  UDP  packet  with
                 destination port 53, creates a flow which matches <b>udp_dst=53</b>.

       The  <u>field</u> and <u>src</u> arguments above should be fields or subfields in the
       syntax described under <u>Field</u> <u>Specifications</u> above.

       Match field specifications must honor prerequisites for both  the  flow
       with  the <b>learn</b> and the new flow that it creates.  Consider the follow‐
       ing complete flow, in the syntax accepted by <b>ovs-ofctl</b>.  If the  flow’s
       match  on <b>udp</b> were omitted, then the flow would not satisfy the prereq‐
       uisites for the <b>learn</b> action’s use of  <b>udp_src</b>.   If  <b>dl_type=0x800</b>  or
       <b>nw_proto</b>  were  omitted from <b>learn</b>, then the new flow would not satisfy
       the prerequisite for its match on <b>udp_dst</b>.   For  more  information  on
       prerequisites, please refer to <b>ovs-fields(7)</b>:

          udp, actions=learn(dl_type=0x800, nw_proto=17, udp_dst=udp_src)

       Actions for the new flow are specified as follows.  At least one action
       should ordinarily be specified:

          <b>load:</b><u>value</u><b>-&gt;</b><u>dst</u>
                 Adds  a  <b>load</b>  action  to the new flow that loads the literal
                 <u>value</u> into <u>dst</u>.  The syntax is the same as  the  <b>load</b>  action
                 explained in the <u>Field</u> <u>Modification</u> <u>Actions</u> section.

          <b>load:</b><u>src</u><b>-&gt;</b><u>dst</u>
                 Adds a <b>load</b> action to the new flow that loads <u>src</u>, a field or
                 subfield from the packet being processed, into <u>dst</u>.

          <b>output:</b><u>field</u>
                 Adds  an <b>output</b> action to the new flow’s actions that outputs
                 to the OpenFlow port taken from <u>field</u>, which must be a  field
                 as described above.

          <b>fin_idle_timeout=</b><u>seconds</u> <b>/</b> <b>fin_hard_timeout=</b><u>seconds</u>
                 Adds a <b>fin_timeout</b> action with the specified arguments to the
                 new flow.  This feature was added in Open vSwitch 1.6.

       The following additional arguments are optional:
          <b>idle_timeout=</b><u>seconds</u>

          <b>hard_timeout=</b><u>seconds</u>

          <b>priority=</b><u>value</u>

          <b>cookie=</b><u>value</u>

          <b>send_flow_rem</b>
                 These  arguments  have  the same meaning as in the usual flow
                 syntax documented in <b>ovs-ofctl(8)</b>.

          <b>table=</b><u>table</u>
                 The table in which the new flow should be inserted.   Specify
                 a decimal number between 0 and 254 inclusive or the name of a
                 table.  The default, if table is unspecified, is table 1 (not
                 0).

          <b>delete_learned</b>
                 When  this flag is specified, deleting the flow that contains
                 the <b>learn</b> action will also delete the flows created by <b>learn</b>.
                 Specifically, when the last <b>learn</b> action with this  flag  and
                 particular  <b>table</b>  and  <b>cookie</b>  values is removed, the switch
                 deletes all of the flows in  the  specified  table  with  the
                 specified cookie.

                 This flag was added in Open vSwitch 2.4.

          <b>limit=</b><u>number</u>
                 If  the number of flows in the new flow’s table with the same
                 cookie exceeds <u>number</u>, the action will not add  a  new  flow.
                 By default, or with <b>limit=0</b>, there is no limit.

                 This flag was added in Open vSwitch 2.8.

          <b>result_dst=</b><u>field</u><b>[</b><u>bit</u><b>]</b>
                 If  learn  fails (because the number of flows exceeds <b>limit</b>),
                 the action sets <u>field</u>[<u>bit</u>] to 0, otherwise it will be set  to
                 1.  <u>field</u>[<u>bit</u>] must be a single bit.

                 This flag was added in Open vSwitch 2.8.

       By  itself, the <b>learn</b> action can only put two kinds of actions into the
       flows that it creates: <b>load</b> and <b>output</b> actions.  If <b>learn</b>  is  used  in
       isolation, these are severe limits.

       However, <b>learn</b> is not meant to be used in isolation.  It is a primitive
       meant  to  be  used together with other Open vSwitch features to accom‐
       plish a task.  Its existing features  are  enough  to  accomplish  most
       tasks.

       Here is an outline of a typical pipeline structure that allows for ver‐
       satile behavior using <b>learn</b>:

          • Flows  in  table <b>A</b> contain a <b>learn</b> action, that populates flows in
            table <b>L</b>, that use a <b>load</b> action to populate register <b>R</b> with infor‐
            mation about what was learned.

          • Flows in table <b>B</b> contain two sequential resubmit actions:  one  to
            table <b>L</b> and another one to table <b>B</b> <b>+</b> <b>1</b>.

          • Flows  in  table <b>B</b> <b>+</b> <b>1</b> match on register <b>R</b> and act differently de‐
            pending on what the flows in table <b>L</b> loaded into it.

       This approach can be used to implement many <b>learn</b>-based features.   For
       example:

          • Resubmit  to  a  table selected based on learned information, e.g.
            see
            <u>https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-discuss/2016-June/021694.html</u>
            .

          • MAC learning in the middle of a pipeline, as described in the <b>Open</b>
            <b>vSwitch</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Features</b> <b>Tutorial</b> in the OVS documentation.

          • TCP state based  firewalling,  by  learning  outgoing  connections
            based  on  SYN packets and matching them up with incoming packets.
            (This is usually better implemented using the <b>ct</b> action.)

          • At least some of the features described in T. A.  Hoff,  <b>Extending</b>
            <b>Open</b> <b>vSwitch</b> <b>to</b> <b>Facilitate</b> <b>Creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stateful</b> <b>SDN</b> <b>Applications</b>.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              The  <b>learn</b> action is an Open vSwitch extension to OpenFlow added
              in Open vSwitch 1.3.  Some features of <b>learn</b> were added in later
              versions, as noted individually above.

   <b>The</b> <b>fin_timeout</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>fin_timeout(</b><u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>...)</b>


       This action changes the idle timeout or hard timeout, or both,  of  the
       OpenFlow flow that contains it, when the flow matches a TCP packet with
       the  FIN  or  RST flag.  When such a packet is observed, the action re‐
       duces the rule’s timeouts to those specified on  the  action.   If  the
       rule’s existing timeout is already shorter than the one that the action
       specifies, then that timeout is unaffected.

       The timeouts are specified as key-value pairs:

          <b>idle_timeout=</b><u>seconds</u>
                 Causes  the  flow to expire after the given number of seconds
                 of inactivity.

          <b>hard_timeout=</b><u>seconds</u>
                 Causes the flow to expire after the given number of  <u>seconds</u>,
                 regardless  of  activity.   (<u>seconds</u> specifies time since the
                 flow’s creation, not since the receipt of the FIN or RST.)

       This action is normally added to a learned flow by  the  <b>learn</b>  action.
       It is unlikely to be useful otherwise.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              This  Open  vSwitch  extension  action was added in Open vSwitch
              1.6.

<b>PROGRAMMING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>FLOW</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
   <b>The</b> <b>resubmit</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>resubmit:</b><u>port</u>
              <b>resubmit([</b><u>port</u><b>],[</b><u>table</u>][,ct])``


       Searches an OpenFlow flow table for a matching flow  and  executes  the
       actions found, if any, before continuing to the following action in the
       current flow entry.  Arguments can customize the search:

          • If <u>port</u> is given as an OpenFlow port number or name, then it spec‐
            ifies  a value to use for the input port metadata field as part of
            the search, in place of the input  port  currently  in  the  flow.
            Specifying <b>in_port</b> as <b>port</b> is equivalent to omitting it.

          • If <u>table</u> is given as an integer between 0 and 254 or a table name,
            it  specifies  the  OpenFlow table to search.  If it is not speci‐
            fied, the table from the current flow is used.

          • If <b>ct</b> is specified, then the search is done  with  packet  5-tuple
            fields swapped with the corresponding conntrack original direction
            tuple fields.  See the documentation for <b>ct</b> above, for more infor‐
            mation  about  connection  tracking,  or <b>ovs-fields(7)</b> for details
            about the connection tracking fields.

            This flag requires a valid connection tracking state  as  a  match
            prerequisite in the flow where this action is placed.  Examples of
            valid  connection  tracking  state  matches include <b>ct_state=+new</b>,
            <b>ct_state=+est</b>, <b>ct_state=+rel</b>, and <b>ct_state=+trk-inv</b>.

       The changes, if any, to the input port and connection  tracking  fields
       are  just for searching the flow table.  The changes are not visible to
       actions or to later flow table lookups.

       The most common use of <b>resubmit</b> is to visit another flow table  without
       <u>port</u> or <b>ct</b>, like this: <b>resubmit(,</b><u>table</u><b>)</b>.

       Recursive <b>resubmit</b> actions are permitted.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              The  <b>resubmit</b> action is an Open vSwitch extension.  However, the
              <b>goto_table</b> instruction in OpenFlow 1.1 and later can  be  viewed
              as a kind of restricted <b>resubmit</b>.

              Open vSwitch 1.3 added <b>table</b>.  Open vSwitch 2.7 added <b>ct</b>.

              Open  vSwitch  imposes a limit on <b>resubmit</b> recursion that varies
              among version:

                 • Open vSwitch 1.0.1 and earlier did not support recursion.

                 • Open vSwitch 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 limited recursion to 8 levels.

                 • Open vSwitch 1.1 and 1.2 limited recursion to 16 levels.

                 • Open vSwitch 1.2 through 1.8 limited recursion to  32  lev‐
                   els.

                 • Open  vSwitch  1.9 through 2.0 limited recursion to 64 lev‐
                   els.

                 • Open vSwitch 2.1 through 2.5 limited recursion to 64 levels
                   and impose a total limit of 4,096 resubmits per flow trans‐
                   lation (earlier versions did not impose any total limit).

                 • Open vSwitch 2.6 and later imposes the same limits as  2.5,
                   with  one exception: resubmit from table <b>x</b> to any table <b>y</b> <b>&gt;</b>
                   <b>x</b> does not count against the recursion depth limit.

   <b>The</b> <b>clone</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>clone(</b><u>action</u><b>...)</b>


       Executes each nested <u>action</u>, saving much of  the  packet  and  pipeline
       state  beforehand  and  then restoring it afterward.  The state that is
       saved and restored includes all flow data and metadata (including,  for
       example,  <b>in_port</b> and <b>ct_state</b>), the stack accessed by <b>push</b> and <b>pop</b> ac‐
       tions, and the OpenFlow action set.

       This action was added in Open vSwitch 2.7.

   <b>The</b> <b>push</b> <b>and</b> <b>pop</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>push:</b><u>src</u>
              <b>pop:</b><u>dst</u>


       The <b>push</b> action pushes <u>src</u> on a general-purpose stack.  The <b>pop</b>  action
       pops  an entry off the stack into <u>dst</u>.  <u>src</u> and <u>dst</u> should be fields or
       subfields in the syntax described under <u>Field</u> <u>Specifications</u> above.

       Controllers can use the stack for saving and restoring data or metadata
       around <b>resubmit</b> actions, for swapping or rearranging data and metadata,
       or for other purposes.  Any data or metadata field, or part of one, may
       be pushed, and any modifiable field or subfield may be popped.

       The number of bits pushed in a stack entry do not  have  to  match  the
       number  of  bits later popped from that entry.  If more bits are popped
       from an  entry  than  were  pushed,  then  the  entry  is  conceptually
       left-padded  with  0-bits  as  needed.   If  fewer bits are popped than
       pushed, then bits are conceptually trimmed from the left  side  of  the
       entry.

       The  stack’s  size is limited.  The limit is intended to be high enough
       that <b>normal</b> use will not pose problems.  Stack overflow or underflow is
       an error that stops action execution (see <b>Stack</b> <b>too</b>  <b>deep</b>  under  <u>Error</u>
       <u>Handling</u>, above).

       Examples:

          • <b>push:reg2[0..5]</b>  or <b>push:NXM_NX_REG2[0..5]</b> pushes on the stack the
            6 bits in register 2 bits 0 through 5.

          • <b>pop:reg2[0..5]</b> or <b>pop:NXM_NX_REG2[0..5]</b> pops the value from top of
            the stack and copy bits 0 through 5 of  that  value  into  bits  0
            through 5 of register 2.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open  vSwitch  1.2 introduced <b>push</b> and <b>pop</b> as OpenFlow extension
              actions.

   <b>The</b> <b>exit</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>exit</b>


       This action causes Open vSwitch to immediately halt execution  of  fur‐
       ther actions.  Actions which have already been executed are unaffected.
       Any  further  actions, including those which may be in other tables, or
       different levels of the <b>resubmit</b> call stack, are ignored.  However,  an
       <b>exit</b>  action  within  a  group bucket terminates only execution of that
       bucket, not other buckets or the overall pipeline.  Actions in the  ac‐
       tion  set are still executed (specify <b>clear_actions</b> before <b>exit</b> to dis‐
       card them).

   <b>The</b> <b>multipath</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>multipath(</b><u>fields</u>,<u>basis</u>,<u>algorithm</u>,<u>n</u><b>_</b><u>links</u>,<u>arg</u>,<u>dst</u><b>)</b>


       Hashes <u>fields</u> using <u>basis</u> as a universal hash parameter, then  the  ap‐
       plies multipath link selection <u>algorithm</u> (with parameter <u>arg</u>) to choose
       one  of  <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>links</u>  output  links numbered 0 through <u>n</u><b>_</b><u>links</u> minus 1, and
       stores the link into <u>dst</u>, which must be a field or subfield in the syn‐
       tax described under <u>Field</u> <u>Specifications</u> above.

       The <b>bundle</b> or <b>bundle_load</b> actions are usually easier to use than <b>multi‐</b>
       <b>path</b>.

       <u>fields</u> must be one of the following:

          <b>eth_src</b>
                 Hashes Ethernet source address only.

          <b>symmetric_l4</b>
                 Hashes Ethernet  source,  destination,  and  type,  VLAN  ID,
                 IPv4/IPv6  source, destination, and protocol, and TCP or SCTP
                 (but not UDP) ports.  The hash is computed so that  pairs  of
                 corresponding flows in each direction hash to the same value,
                 in  environments  where  L2 paths are the same in each direc‐
                 tion.  UDP ports are not included in the hash to support pro‐
                 tocols such as VXLAN that use asymmetric ports in each direc‐
                 tion.

          <b>symmetric_l3l4</b>
                 Hashes IPv4/IPv6 source, destination, and protocol,  and  TCP
                 or  SCTP  (but  not UDP) ports.  Like <b>symmetric_l4</b>, this is a
                 symmetric hash, but by excluding L2 headers it is more effec‐
                 tive in environments with asymmetric L2 paths (e.g. paths in‐
                 volving VRRP IP addresses on a  router).   Not  an  effective
                 hash  function  for protocols other than IPv4 and IPv6, which
                 hash to a constant zero.

          <b>symmetric_l3l4+udp</b>
                 Like <b>symmetric_l3l4+udp</b>, but UDP ports are  included  in  the
                 hash.  This is a more effective hash when asymmetric UDP pro‐
                 tocols such as VXLAN are not a consideration.

          <b>symmetric_l3</b>
                 Hashes  network  source  address  and network destination ad‐
                 dress.

          <b>nw_src</b> Hashes network source address only.

          <b>nw_dst</b> Hashes network destination address only.

       The <u>algorithm</u> used to compute the final result <b>link</b> must be one of  the
       following:

          <b>modulo_n</b>
                 Computes <b>link</b> <b>=</b> <b>hash(flow)</b> <b>%</b> <b>n_links</b>.

                 This   algorithm   redistributes  all  traffic  when  <b>n_links</b>
                 changes.  It has <b>O(1)</b> performance.

                 Use 65535 for <b>max_link</b> to get a raw hash value.

                 This algorithm is specified by RFC 2992.

          <b>hash_threshold</b>
                 Computes <b>link</b> <b>=</b> <b>hash(flow)</b> <b>/</b> <b>(MAX_HASH</b> <b>/</b> <b>n_links)</b>.

                 Redistributes between one-quarter  and  one-half  of  traffic
                 when <b>n_links</b> changes.  It has <b>O(1)</b> performance.

                 This algorithm is specified by RFC 2992.

          <b>hrw</b> <b>(Highest</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Weight)</b>
                 Computes the following:

                     for i in [0, n_links]:
                         weights[i] = hash(flow, i)
                     link = { i such that weights[i] &gt;= weights[j] for all j != i }

                 Redistributes  <b>1</b>  <b>/</b>  <b>n_links</b> of traffic when <b>n_links</b> changes.
                 It has <b>O(n_links)</b> performance.  If <b>n_links</b> is greater than  a
                 threshold (currently 64, but subject to change), Open vSwitch
                 will substitute another algorithm automatically.

                 This algorithm is specified by RFC 2992.

          <b>iter_hash</b> <b>(Iterative</b> <b>Hash)</b>
                 Computes the following:

                     i = 0
                     repeat:
                         i = i + 1
                         link = hash(flow, i) % arg
                     while link &gt; max_link

                 Redistributes  <b>1</b>  <b>/</b>  <b>n_links</b> of traffic when <b>n_links</b> changes.
                 <b>O(1)</b> performance when <b>arg</b> <b>/</b> <b>max_link</b> is  bounded  by  a  con‐
                 stant.

                 Redistributes all traffic when <b>arg</b> changes.

                 <u>arg</u>  must  be  greater than <b>max_link</b> and for best performance
                 should be no more than approximately <b>max_link</b> <b>*</b> <b>2</b>.  If <u>arg</u> is
                 outside the acceptable range, Open vSwitch will automatically
                 substitute the least power of 2 greater than <b>max_link</b>.

                 This algorithm is specific to Open vSwitch.

       Only the <b>iter_hash</b> algorithm uses <u>arg</u>.

       It is an error if <b>max_link</b> is greater than or equal to <b>2**n_bits</b>.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              This is an OpenFlow extension added in Open vSwitch 1.1.

<b>OTHER</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
   <b>The</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>conjunction(</b><u>id</u>, <u>k</u>/<u>n</u><b>)</b>


       This action allows for sophisticated <b>conjunctive</b> <b>match</b> flows.  Refer to
       <b>Conjunctive</b> <b>Match</b> <b>Fields</b> in <b>ovs-fields(7)</b> for details.

       A flow that has one or more <b>conjunction</b> actions may not have any  other
       actions except for <b>note</b> actions.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              Open  vSwitch  2.4 introduced the <b>conjunction</b> action and <b>conj_id</b>
              field.  They are Open vSwitch extensions to OpenFlow.

   <b>The</b> <b>note</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>note:[</b><u>hh</u><b>]...</b>


       This action does nothing at all.  OpenFlow controllers may  use  it  to
       annotate flows with more data than can fit in a flow cookie.

       The  action  may  include any number of bytes represented as hex digits
       <u>hh</u>.  Periods may separate pairs of hex digits,  for  readability.   The
       <b>note</b>  action’s  format doesn’t include an exact length for its payload,
       so the provided bytes will be padded on the right by enough bytes  with
       value 0 to make the total number 6 more than a multiple of 8.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              This  action  is  an  extension  to  OpenFlow introduced in Open
              vSwitch 1.1.

   <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>action</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>sample(</b><u>argument</u><b>...)</b>


       Samples packets and sends one sample for every sampled packet.

       The following <u>argument</u> forms are accepted:

          <b>probability=</b><u>packets</u>
                 The number of sampled packets out of 65535.  Must be  greater
                 or equal to 1.

          <b>collector_set_id=</b><u>id</u>
                 The  unsigned  32-bit integer identifier of the set of sample
                 collectors to send sampled packets to.  Defaults to 0.

          <b>obs_domain_id=</b><u>id</u>
                 When sending samples to IPFIX collectors, the unsigned 32-bit
                 integer Observation  Domain  ID  sent  in  every  IPFIX  flow
                 record.  Defaults to 0.

          <b>obs_point_id=</b><u>id</u>
                 When sending samples to IPFIX collectors, the unsigned 32-bit
                 integer Observation Point ID sent in every IPFIX flow record.
                 Defaults to 0.

          <b>sampling_port=</b><u>port</u>
                 Sample packets on <u>port</u>, which should be the ingress or egress
                 port.   This option, which was added in Open vSwitch 2.6, al‐
                 lows the IPFIX implementation to export egress tunnel  infor‐
                 mation.

          <b>ingress</b>

          <b>egress</b> Specifies  explicitly  that  the  packet  is being sampled on
                 ingress to or egress from the switch.  IPFIX reports sent  by
                 Open  vSwitch before version 2.6 did not include a direction.
                 From 2.6 until 2.7, IPFIX reports inferred a  direction  from
                 <b>sampling_port</b>:  if  it was the packet’s output port, then the
                 direction was reported as egress, otherwise as ingress.  Open
                 vSwitch 2.7 introduced these options,  which  allow  the  in‐
                 ferred direction to be overridden.  This is particularly use‐
                 ful when the ingress (or egress) port is not a tunnel.

       Refer to <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</b> for more details on configuring sample
       collector sets.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              This action is an OpenFlow extension added in Open vSwitch 2.4.

<b>INSTRUCTIONS</b>
       Every  version  of  OpenFlow includes actions.  OpenFlow 1.1 introduced
       the higher-level, related concept of <b>instructions</b>.  In OpenFlow 1.1 and
       later, actions within a flow are always encapsulated within an instruc‐
       tion.  Each flow has at most one instruction of each  kind,  which  are
       executed  in the following fixed order defined in the OpenFlow specifi‐
       cation:

          1. <b>Meter</b>

          2. <b>Apply-Actions</b>

          3. <b>Clear-Actions</b>

          4. <b>Write-Actions</b>

          5. <b>Write-Metadata</b>

          6. <b>Stat-Trigger</b> (not supported by Open vSwitch)

          7. <b>Goto-Table</b>

       The most important instruction is <b>Apply-Actions</b>.  This instruction  en‐
       capsulates any number of actions, which the instruction executes.  Open
       vSwitch  does not explicitly represent <b>Apply-Actions</b>.  Instead, any ac‐
       tion by itself is implicitly part of an <b>Apply-Actions</b> instructions.

       Open vSwitch syntax requires other instructions, if present, to  be  in
       the order listed above.  Otherwise it will flag an error.

   <b>The</b> <b>meter</b> <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>meter:</b><u>meter</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>


       Apply meter <u>meter</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>.  If a meter band rate is exceeded, the packet may
       be dropped, or modified, depending on the meter band type.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow  1.3  introduced  the  <b>meter</b> instruction.  OpenFlow 1.5
              changes <b>meter</b> from an instruction to an action.

              OpenFlow 1.5 allows implementations to restrict <b>meter</b> to be  the
              first  action in an action list and to exclude <b>meter</b> from action
              sets, for better compatibility with OpenFlow 1.3 and 1.4.   Open
              vSwitch restricts the <b>meter</b> action both ways.

              Open  vSwitch  2.0  introduced OpenFlow protocol support for me‐
              ters, but it did not include a  datapath  implementation.   Open
              vSwitch 2.7 added meter support to the userspace datapath.  Open
              vSwitch  2.10  added meter support to the kernel datapath.  Open
              vSwitch 2.12 added support for meter as an  action  in  OpenFlow
              1.5.

   <b>The</b> <b>clear_actions</b> <b>instruction</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>clear_actions</b>


       Clears the action set.  See <u>Action</u> <u>Sets</u>, above, for more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow  1.1  introduced <b>clear_actions</b>.  Open vSwitch 2.1 added
              support for <b>clear_actions</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>write_actions</b> <b>instruction</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>write_actions(</b><u>action</u><b>...)</b>


       Adds each <u>action</u> to the action set.  The action set is carried  between
       flow tables and then executed at the end of the pipeline.  Only certain
       actions  may be written to the action set.  See <u>Action</u> <u>Sets</u>, above, for
       more information.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.1 introduced <b>write_actions</b>.  Open vSwitch  2.1  added
              support for <b>write_actions</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>write_metadata</b> <b>instruction</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>write_metadata:</b><u>value</u><b>[/</b><u>mask</u><b>]</b>


       Updates the flow’s <b>metadata</b> field.  If <u>mask</u> is omitted, <b>metadata</b> is set
       exactly  to <u>value</u>; if <u>mask</u> is specified, then a 1-bit in <u>mask</u> indicates
       that the corresponding bit in <b>metadata</b> will be replaced with the corre‐
       sponding bit from <u>value</u>.  Both <u>value</u> and <u>mask</u> are  64-bit  values  that
       are decimal by default; use a <b>0x</b> prefix to specify them in hexadecimal.

       The  <b>metadata</b>  field  can also be matched in the flow table and updated
       with actions such as <b>set_field</b> and <b>move</b>.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.1 introduced <b>write_metadata</b>.  Open vSwitch 2.1  added
              support for <b>write_metadata</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>goto_table</b> <b>instruction</b>
       <b>Syntax</b>:
              <b>goto_table:</b><u>table</u>


       Jumps  to  <u>table</u>  as the next table in the process pipeline.  The table
       may be a number between 0 and 254 or a table name.

       It is an error if <u>table</u> is less than or equal to the table of the  flow
       that contains it; that is, <b>goto_table</b> must move forward in the OpenFlow
       pipeline.   Since <b>goto_table</b> must be the last instruction in a flow, it
       never leads to recursion.  The <b>resubmit</b> extension action is more flexi‐
       ble.

       <b>Conformance</b>
              OpenFlow 1.1 introduced <b>goto_table</b>.  Open vSwitch 2.1 added sup‐
              port for <b>goto_table</b>.
