.SH NAME
ovs\-vsctl \- utility for querying and configuring \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand
\fR[\fIargs\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIargs\fR]]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovs\-vsctl\fR program configures \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR(8) by
providing a high\-level interface to its configuration database.
See \fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for comprehensive documentation of
the database schema.
.PP
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR connects to an \fBovsdb\-server\fR process that
maintains an Open vSwitch configuration database.  Using this
connection, it queries and possibly applies changes to the database,
depending on the supplied commands.  Then, if it applied any changes,
by default it waits until \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR has finished
reconfiguring itself before it exits.  (If you use \fBovs\-vsctl\fR
when \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is not running, use \fB\-\-no\-wait\fR.)
.PP
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR can perform any number of commands in a single run,
implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.
.PP
The \fBovs\-vsctl\fR command line begins with global options (see
\fBOPTIONS\fR below for details).  The global options are followed by
one or more commands.  Each command should begin with \fB\-\-\fR by
itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the following
commands.  (The \fB\-\-\fR before the first command is optional.)  The
command
itself starts with command-specific options, if any, followed by the
command name and any arguments.  See \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for syntax
examples.
.
.SS "Linux VLAN Bridging Compatibility"
The \fBovs\-vsctl\fR program supports the model of a bridge
implemented by Open vSwitch, in which a single bridge supports ports
on multiple VLANs.  In this model, each port on a bridge is either a
trunk port that potentially passes packets tagged with 802.1Q headers
that designate VLANs or it is assigned a single implicit VLAN that is
never tagged with an 802.1Q header.
.PP
For compatibility with software designed for the Linux bridge,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR also supports a model in which traffic associated
with a given 802.1Q VLAN is segregated into a separate bridge.  A
special form of the \fBadd\-br\fR command (see below) creates a ``fake
bridge'' within an Open vSwitch bridge to simulate this behavior.
When such a ``fake bridge'' is active, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will treat it
much like a bridge separate from its ``parent bridge,'' but the actual
implementation in Open vSwitch uses only a single bridge, with ports on
the fake bridge assigned the implicit VLAN of the fake bridge of which
they are members.  (A fake bridge for VLAN 0 receives packets that
have no 802.1Q tag or a tag with VLAN 0.)
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
The following options affect the behavior \fBovs\-vsctl\fR as a whole.
Some individual commands also accept their own options, which are
given just before the command name.  If the first command on the
command line has options, then those options must be separated from
the global options by \fB\-\-\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-db=\fIserver\fR"
Sets \fIserver\fR as the database server that \fBovs\-vsctl\fR
contacts to query or modify configuration.  \fIserver\fR may be an
OVSDB active or passive connection method, as described in
\fBovsdb\fR(7).  The default is \fBunix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-wait\fR"
Prevents \fBovs\-vsctl\fR from waiting for \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR to
reconfigure itself according to the modified database.  This
option should be used if \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is not running;
otherwise, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will not exit until \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
starts.
.IP
This option has no effect if the commands specified do not change the
database.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-syslog\fR"
By default, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR logs its arguments and the details of any
changes that it makes to the system log.  This option disables this
logging.
.IP
This option is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose=vsctl:syslog:warn\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-oneline\fR"
Modifies the output format so that the output for each command is printed
on a single line.  New-line characters that would otherwise separate
lines are printed as \fB\\n\fR, and any instances of \fB\\\fR that
would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.
Prints a blank line for each command that has no output.
This option does not affect the formatting of output from the
\fBlist\fR or \fBfind\fR commands; see \fBTable Formatting Options\fR
below.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
Prevents \fBovs\-vsctl\fR from actually modifying the database.
.
.IP "\fB\-t \fIsecs\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fR"
By default, or with a \fIsecs\fR of \fB0\fR, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR waits
forever for a response from the database.  This option limits runtime
to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds.  If the timeout expires,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR signal.  (A timeout
would normally happen only if the database cannot be contacted, or if
the system is overloaded.)
.
.IP "\fB\-\-retry\fR"
Without this option, if \fBovs\-vsctl\fR connects outward to the
database server (the default) then \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will try to
connect once and exit with an error if the connection fails (which
usually means that \fBovsdb\-server\fR is not running).
.IP
With this option, or if \fB\-\-db\fR specifies that \fBovs\-vsctl\fR
should listen for an incoming connection from the database server,
then \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will wait for a connection to the database
forever.
.IP
Regardless of this setting, \fB\-\-timeout\fR always limits how long
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR will wait.
.
.SS "Table Formatting Options"
These options control the format of output from the \fBlist\fR and
\fBfind\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-f \fIformat\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-format=\fIformat\fR"
Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of
\fIformat\fR are available:
.RS
.ie '\*(PN'ovsdb\-client' .IP "\fBtable\fR (default)"
.el                       .IP "\fBtable\fR"
2-D text tables with aligned columns.
.ie '\*(PN'ovsdb\-client' .IP "\fBlist\fR"
.el                       .IP "\fBlist\fR (default)"
A list with one column per line and rows separated by a blank line.
.IP "\fBhtml\fR"
HTML tables.
.IP "\fBcsv\fR"
Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.
.IP "\fBjson\fR"
JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a sequence of JSON
objects, each of which corresponds to one table.  Each JSON object has
the following members with the noted values:
.RS
.IP "\fBcaption\fR"
The table's caption.  This member is omitted if the table has no
caption.
.IP "\fBheadings\fR"
An array with one element per table column.  Each array element is a
string giving the corresponding column's heading.
.IP "\fBdata\fR"
An array with one element per table row.  Each element is also an
array with one element per table column.  The elements of this
second-level array are the cells that constitute the table.  Cells
that represent OVSDB data or data types are expressed in the format
described in the OVSDB specification; other cells are simply expressed
as text strings.
.RE
.RE
.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIformat\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-data=\fIformat\fR"
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless the table
format is set to \fBjson\fR, in which case \fBjson\fR formatting is
always used when formatting cells.  The following types of \fIformat\fR
are available:
.RS
.IP "\fBstring\fR (default)"
The simple format described in the \fBDatabase Values\fR
.ie '\*(PN'ovs\-vsctl' section below.
.el                    section of \fBovs\-vsctl\fR(8).
.IP "\fBbare\fR"
The simple format with punctuation stripped off: \fB[]\fR and \fB{}\fR
are omitted around sets, maps, and empty columns, items within sets
and maps are space-separated, and strings are never quoted.  This
format may be easier for scripts to parse.
.IP "\fBjson\fR"
The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.
.RE
.IP
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-headings\fR"
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in the
first row of table output.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-pretty\fR"
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as possible.  This
option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more readable
fashion.  Members of objects and elements of arrays are printed one
per line, with indentation.
.IP
This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is always printed
compactly.
.IP "\fB\-\-bare\fR"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-format=list \-\-data=bare \-\-no\-headings\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-column-width=\fIn\fR"
For table output only, limits the width of any column in the output to
\fIn\fR columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to fit, as necessary.
Columns are always wide enough to display the column names, if the
heading row is printed.
.
.SS "Public Key Infrastructure Options"
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIprivkey.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-private\-key=\fIprivkey.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as \fB\*(PN\fR's
identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.
.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIcert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-certificate=\fIcert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
private key specified on \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-private\-key\fR to be
trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the certificate
authority (CA) that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to
verify it.
.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIcacert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that \fB\*(PN\fR
should use to verify certificates presented to it by SSL/TLS peers.
(This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use to verify the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may
be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
.
.IP "\fB\-C none\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=none\fR"
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL/TLS peers.  This
introduces a security risk, because it means that certificates cannot
be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
When \fIcacert.pem\fR exists, this option has the same effect as
\fB\-C\fR or \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.  If it does not exist, then
\fB\*(PN\fR will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the
SSL/TLS peer on its first SSL/TLS connection and save it to the named
PEM file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection
and reconnect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be
authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus
obtained.
.IP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL/TLS connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.IP
This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA certificate
as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS protocols do not
require the server to send the CA certificate.
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-C\fR and
\fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-peer\-ca\-cert=\fIpeer-cacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional certificates
to send to SSL/TLS peers.  \fIpeer-cacert.pem\fR should be the CA
certificate used to sign \fB\*(PN\fR's own certificate, that is, the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR.  If
\fB\*(PN\fR's certificate is self-signed, then \fB\-\-certificate\fR
and \fB\-\-peer\-ca\-cert\fR should specify the same file.
.IP
This option is not useful in normal operation, because the SSL/TLS peer
must already have the CA certificate for the peer to have any
confidence in \fB\*(PN\fR's identity.  However, this offers a way for
a new installation to bootstrap the CA certificate on its first SSL/TLS
connection.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.  (If \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR closes
its standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
effect.)
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIdestination\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vFACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=FACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. \fIfacility\fR can be one of
\fBkern\fR, \fBuser\fR, \fBmail\fR, \fBdaemon\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBsyslog\fR,
\fBlpr\fR, \fBnews\fR, \fBuucp\fR, \fBclock\fR, \fBftp\fR, \fBntp\fR,
\fBaudit\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBclock2\fR, \fBlocal0\fR, \fBlocal1\fR,
\fBlocal2\fR, \fBlocal3\fR, \fBlocal4\fR, \fBlocal5\fR, \fBlocal6\fR or
\fBlocal7\fR. If this option is not specified, \fBdaemon\fR is used as
the default for the local system syslog and \fBlocal0\fR is used while sending
a message to the target provided via the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-method=\fImethod\fR"
Specify \fImethod\fR how syslog messages should be sent to syslog daemon.
Following forms are supported:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBlibc\fR, use libc \fBsyslog()\fR function.
Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over \fB/dev/log\fR
UNIX domain socket.
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fR\fR, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possible to
specify arbitrary message format with this option.  However,
\fBrsyslogd 8.9\fR and older versions use hard coded parser function anyway
that limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use arbitrary message
format with older \fBrsyslogd\fR versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
IP address instead.
.IP \(bu
\fBudp:\fIip\fR:\fIport\fR\fR, use UDP socket.  With this method it is
possible to use arbitrary message format also with older \fBrsyslogd\fR.
When sending syslog messages over UDP socket extra precaution needs to
be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be
interfering with local syslog traffic and there are some security
considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain
sockets.
.IP \(bu
\fBnull\fR, discards all messages logged to syslog.
.RE
.IP
The default is taken from the \fBOVS_SYSLOG_METHOD\fR environment
variable; if it is unset, the default is \fBlibc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-help\fR"
Prints a brief help message to the console.
.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-version\fR"
Prints version information to the console.
.
.SH COMMANDS
The commands implemented by \fBovs\-vsctl\fR are described in the
sections below.
.SS "Open vSwitch Commands"
These commands work with an Open vSwitch as a whole.
.
.IP "\fBinit\fR"
Initializes the Open vSwitch database, if it is empty.  If the
database has already been initialized, this command has no effect.
.IP
Any successful \fBovs\-vsctl\fR command automatically initializes the
Open vSwitch database if it is empty.  This command is provided to
initialize the database without executing any other command.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIfilter\-rule\fR[,\fIfilter\-rule\fR]...] \fBshow\fR"
Prints a brief overview of the database contents.  If \fB\-\-filter\fR is
specified, output is filtered according to the rules.  Each \fIfilter\-rule\fR
has the form \fBtable\-name\fR(\fIfilter\fR[|\fIfilter\fR]...).  The row in
this table is shown only if the printed version of it, including all the rows
referenced from this one, contains one of the \fIfilter\fRs as a sub-string.
.
.IP "\fBemer\-reset\fR"
Reset the configuration into a clean state.  It deconfigures OpenFlow
controllers, OVSDB servers, and SSL/TLS, and deletes port mirroring,
\fBfail_mode\fR, NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX configuration.  This
command also removes all \fBother\-config\fR keys from all database
records, except that \fBother\-config:hwaddr\fR is preserved if it is
present in a Bridge record.  Other networking configuration is left
as-is.
.
.SS "Bridge Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch bridges.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-br \fIbridge\fR"
Creates a new bridge named \fIbridge\fR.  Initially the bridge will
have no ports (other than \fIbridge\fR itself).
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a bridge that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIbridge\fR already exists as a real bridge.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-br \fIbridge parent vlan\fR"
Creates a ``fake bridge'' named \fIbridge\fR within the existing Open
vSwitch bridge \fIparent\fR, which must already exist and must not
itself be a fake bridge.  The new fake bridge will be on 802.1Q VLAN
\fIvlan\fR, which must be an integer between 0 and 4095.  The parent
bridge must not already have a fake bridge for \fIvlan\fR.  Initially
\fIbridge\fR will have no ports (other than \fIbridge\fR itself).
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a bridge that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIbridge\fR already exists as a VLAN bridge under
\fIparent\fR for \fIvlan\fR.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-br \fIbridge\fR"
Deletes \fIbridge\fR and all of its ports.  If \fIbridge\fR is a real
bridge, this command also deletes any fake bridges that were created
with \fIbridge\fR as parent, including all of their ports.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a bridge that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a bridge that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-real\fR|\fB\-\-fake\fR] \fBlist\-br\fR"
Lists all existing real and fake bridges on standard output, one per
line.  With \fB\-\-real\fR or \fB\-\-fake\fR, only bridges of that type
are returned.

.IP "\fBbr\-exists \fIbridge\fR"
Tests whether \fIbridge\fR exists as a real or fake bridge.  If so,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR exits successfully with exit code 0.  If not,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR exits unsuccessfully with exit code 2.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-to\-vlan \fIbridge\fR"
If \fIbridge\fR is a fake bridge, prints the bridge's 802.1Q VLAN as a
decimal integer.  If \fIbridge\fR is a real bridge, prints 0.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-to\-parent \fIbridge\fR"
If \fIbridge\fR is a fake bridge, prints the name of its parent
bridge.  If \fIbridge\fR is a real bridge, print \fIbridge\fR.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-set\-external\-id \fIbridge key\fR [\fIvalue\fR]"
Sets or clears an ``external ID'' value on \fIbridge\fR.  These values
are intended to identify entities external to Open vSwitch with which
\fIbridge\fR is associated, e.g. the bridge's identifier in a
virtualization management platform.  The Open vSwitch database schema
specifies well-known \fIkey\fR values, but \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR
are otherwise arbitrary strings.
.IP
If \fIvalue\fR is specified, then \fIkey\fR is set to \fIvalue\fR for
\fIbridge\fR, overwriting any previous value.  If \fIvalue\fR is
omitted, then \fIkey\fR is removed from \fIbridge\fR's set of external
IDs (if it was present).
.IP
For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to that of a
\fBset\fR or \fBremove\fR command in the \fBexternal\-ids\fR column of
the \fBBridge\fR table.  For fake bridges, it actually modifies keys
with names prefixed by \fBfake\-bridge\-\fR in the \fBPort\fR table.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-get\-external\-id \fIbridge\fR [\fIkey\fR]"
Queries the external IDs on \fIbridge\fR.  If \fIkey\fR is specified,
the output is the value for that \fIkey\fR or the empty string if
\fIkey\fR is unset.  If \fIkey\fR is omitted, the output is
\fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR, one per line, for each key-value pair.
.IP
For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to that of a
\fBget\fR command in the \fBexternal\-ids\fR column of the
\fBBridge\fR table.  For fake bridges, it queries keys with names
prefixed by \fBfake\-bridge\-\fR in the \fBPort\fR table.
.
.SS "Port Commands"
.
These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch ports.  These
commands treat a bonded port as a single entity.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ports \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all of the ports within \fIbridge\fR on standard output, one per
line.  The local port \fIbridge\fR is not included in the list.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-port \fIbridge port \fR[\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]\fR=\fIvalue\fR]\&...\fR"
Creates on \fIbridge\fR a new port named \fIport\fR from the network
device of the same name.
.IP
Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record created by
the command.  For example, \fBtag=9\fR would make the port an access
port for VLAN 9.  The syntax is the same as that for the \fBset\fR
command (see \fBDatabase Commands\fR below).
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a port that exists
is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does nothing if
\fIport\fR already exists on \fIbridge\fR and is not a bonded port.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-port \fR[\fIbridge\fR] \fIport\fR"
Deletes \fIport\fR.  If \fIbridge\fR is omitted, \fIport\fR is removed
from whatever bridge contains it; if \fIbridge\fR is specified, it
must be the real or fake bridge that contains \fIport\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a port that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a port that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fB\-\-with\-iface del\-port \fR[\fIbridge\fR] \fIiface\fR"
Deletes the port named \fIiface\fR or that has an interface named
\fIiface\fR.  If \fIbridge\fR is omitted, the port is removed from
whatever bridge contains it; if \fIbridge\fR is specified, it must be
the real or fake bridge that contains the port.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete the port for an
interface that does not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR,
attempting to delete the port for an interface that does not exist has
no effect.

.IP "\fBport\-to\-br \fIport\fR"
Prints the name of the bridge that contains \fIport\fR on standard
output.
.
.SS "Bond Commands"
.
These commands work with ports that have more than one interface,
which Open vSwitch calls ``bonds.''
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-fake\-iface\fR] \fBadd\-bond \fIbridge port iface\fR\&... [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]\fR=\fIvalue\fR]\&...\fR"
Creates on \fIbridge\fR a new port named \fIport\fR that bonds
together the network devices given as each \fIiface\fR.  At least two
interfaces must be named.  If the interfaces are DPDK enabled then
the transaction will need to include operations to explicitly set the
interface type to 'dpdk'.
.IP
Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record created by
the command.  The syntax is the same as that for the \fBset\fR command
(see \fBDatabase Commands\fR below).
.IP
With \fB\-\-fake\-iface\fR, a fake interface with the name \fIport\fR is
created.  This should only be used for compatibility with legacy
software that requires it.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a port that exists
is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does nothing if
\fIport\fR already exists on \fIbridge\fR and bonds together exactly
the specified interfaces.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-bond\-iface \fIbond iface\fR"
Adds \fIiface\fR as a new bond interface to the existing port
\fIbond\fR.  If \fIbond\fR previously had only one port, this
transforms it into a bond.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to add an \fIiface\fR that is
already part of \fIbond\fR is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR,
this command does nothing if \fIiface\fR is already part of
\fIbond\fR.  (It is still an error if \fIiface\fR is an interface of
some other port or bond.)
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-bond\-iface\fR [\fIbond\fR] \fIiface\fR"
Removes \fIiface\fR from its port.  If \fIbond\fR is omitted,
\fIiface\fR is removed from whatever port contains it; if \fIbond\fR
is specified, it must be the port that contains \fIbond\fR.
.IP
If removing \fIiface\fR causes its port to have only a single
interface, then that port transforms from a bond into an ordinary
port.  It is an error if \fIiface\fR is the only interface in its
port.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete an interface that
does not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete an interface that does not exist has no effect.
.
.SS "Interface Commands"
.
These commands examine the interfaces attached to an Open vSwitch
bridge.  These commands treat a bonded port as a collection of two or
more interfaces, rather than as a single port.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ifaces \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all of the interfaces within \fIbridge\fR on standard output,
one per line.  The local port \fIbridge\fR is not included in the
list.

These commands query and modify datapath CT zones, Timeout Policies and Limits.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-zone\-tp \fIdatapath \fBzone=\fIzone_id \fIpolicies\fR"
Creates a conntrack zone timeout policy with \fIzone_id\fR in
\fIdatapath\fR.  The \fIpolicies\fR consist of \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR
pairs, separated by spaces.  For example, \fBicmp_first=30
icmp_reply=60\fR specifies a 30-second timeout policy for the first ICMP
packet and a 60-second policy for ICMP reply packets.  See the
\fBCT_Timeout_Policy\fR table in \fBovs-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for the
supported keys.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to add a \fIpolicy\fR for

Delete the timeout policy associated with \fIzone_id\fR from \fIdatapath\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a policy for zone that
does not exist or doesn't have a policy is an error.  With

.IP "\fBlist\-dp\-cap \fIdatapath\fR"
Prints the datapath's capabilities.
.
.SS "OpenFlow Controller Connectivity"
.
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR can perform all configured bridging and switching
locally, or it can be configured to communicate with one or more
external OpenFlow controllers.  The switch is typically configured to
connect to a primary controller that takes charge of the bridge's flow
table to implement a network policy.  In addition, the switch can be
configured to listen to connections from service controllers.  Service
controllers are typically used for occasional support and maintenance,
e.g. with \fBovs\-ofctl\fR.
.
.IP "\fBget\-controller\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Prints the configured controller target.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-controller\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Deletes the configured controller target.
.
.IP "\fBset\-controller\fR \fIbridge\fR \fItarget\fR\&..."
Sets the configured controller target or targets.  Each \fItarget\fR may
use any of the following forms:
.
.RS
.IP "\fBssl:\fIhost\fR[\fB:\fIport\fR]"
.IQ "\fBtcp:\fIhost\fR[\fB:\fIport\fR]"
The specified \fIport\fR on the given \fIhost\fR, which can
be expressed either as a DNS name (if built with unbound library)
or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6 address format.  Wrap IPv6 addresses
in square brackets, e.g. \fBtcp:[::1]:6653\fR.  On Linux, use
\fB%\fIdevice\fR to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level addresses,
e.g. \fBtcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653\fR.  For \fBssl\fR, the
\fB\-\-private\-key\fR, \fB\-\-certificate\fR, and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR
options are mandatory.
.IP
If \fIport\fR is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

On Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is represented by a
file created in the path \fIfile\fR to mimic the behavior of a Unix
domain socket.
.IP "\fBpssl:\fR[\fIport\fR][\fB:\fIhost\fR]"
.IQ "\fBptcp:\fR[\fIport\fR][\fB:\fIhost\fR]"
Listens for OpenFlow connections on \fIport\fR.  The default
\fIport\fR is 6653.  By default, connections are allowed from any IPv4
address.  Specify \fIhost\fR as an IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6
address (e.g. \fBptcp:6653:[::1]\fR).  On Linux, use \fB%\fIdevice\fR
to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level addresses,
e.g. \fBptcp:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]\fR.  DNS names can
be used if built with unbound library.  For \fBpssl\fR, the
\fB\-\-private\-key\fR,\fB\-\-certificate\fR, and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR
options are mandatory.

.ST "Controller Failure Settings"
.PP
When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible for
setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if the connection to
the controller fails, no new network connections can be set up.  If
the connection to the controller stays down long enough, no packets
can pass through the switch at all.
.PP
If the value is \fBstandalone\fR, or if neither of these settings
is set, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will take over
responsibility for setting up
flows when no message has been received from the controller for three
times the inactivity probe interval.  In this mode,
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR causes the datapath to act like an ordinary
MAC-learning switch.  \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will continue to retry connecting
to the controller in the background and, when the connection succeeds,
it discontinues its standalone behavior.
.PP
If this option is set to \fBsecure\fR, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will not
set up flows on its own when the controller connection fails.
.
.IP "\fBget\-fail\-mode\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Prints the configured failure mode.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-fail\-mode\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Deletes the configured failure mode.
.
.IP "\fBset\-fail\-mode\fR \fIbridge\fR \fBstandalone\fR|\fBsecure\fR"
Sets the configured failure mode.
.
.SS "Manager Connectivity"
.
These commands manipulate the \fBmanager_options\fR column in the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table and rows in the \fBManagers\fR table.  When
\fBovsdb\-server\fR is configured to use the \fBmanager_options\fR column for
OVSDB connections (as described in the startup scripts provided with
Open vSwitch; the corresponding \fBovsdb\-server\fR command option is
\fB--remote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options\fR), this allows the
administrator to use \fBovs\-vsctl\fR to configure database connections.
.
.IP "\fBget\-manager\fR"
Prints the configured manager(s).
.
.IP "\fBdel\-manager\fR"
Deletes the configured manager(s).
.
.IP "\fBset\-manager\fR \fItarget\fR\&..."
Sets the configured manager target or targets.
Each \fItarget\fR may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method,
e.g. \fBpssl:6640\fR, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).
.
.SS "SSL/TLS Configuration"
When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is configured to connect over SSL/TLS for management
or controller connectivity, the following parameters are required:
.TP
\fIprivate-key\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as the virtual
switch's identity for SSL/TLS connections to the controller.
.TP
\fIcertificate\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the
certificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager, that
certifies the virtual switch's private key, identifying a trustworthy
switch.
.TP
\fIca-cert\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify that
the virtual switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.
.PP
These files are read only once, at \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR startup time.  If
their contents change, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR must be killed and restarted.
.PP
These SSL/TLS settings apply to all SSL/TLS connections made by the virtual
switch.
.
.IP "\fBget\-ssl\fR"
Prints the SSL/TLS configuration.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-ssl\fR"
Deletes the current SSL/TLS configuration.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR] \fBset\-ssl\fR \fIprivate-key\fR \fIcertificate\fR \fIca-cert\fR"
Sets the SSL/TLS configuration.  The \fB\-\-bootstrap\fR option is described
below.
.
.ST "CA Certificate Bootstrap"
.PP
Ordinarily, all of the files named in the SSL/TLS configuration must exist
when \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts.  However, if the \fIca-cert\fR file
does not exist and the \fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
option is given, then \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will attempt to obtain the
CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL/TLS connection and
save it to the named PEM file.  If it is successful, it will
immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on all
SSL/TLS connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by the
CA certificate thus obtained.
.PP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL/TLS connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.PP
This option is only useful if the controller sends its CA certificate
as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS protocols do not
require the controller to send the CA certificate.
.
.SS "Auto-Attach Commands"
.
The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard describes a compact method of using
IEEE 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE 802.1aq
Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices to
individual services in a SPB network.  The intent here is to allow network
applications and devices using OVS to be able to easily take advantage of
features offered by industry standard SPB networks. A fundamental element of
the Auto-Attach feature is to map traditional VLANs onto SPB I_SIDs. These
commands manage the Auto-Attach I-SID/VLAN mappings.
.
.IP "\fBadd\-aa\-mapping \fIbridge i-sid vlan\fR"
Creates a new Auto-Attach mapping on \fIbridge\fR for \fIi-sid\fR
and \fIvlan\fR.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-aa\-mapping \fIbridge i-sid vlan\fR"
Deletes an Auto-Attach mapping on \fIbridge\fR for \fIi-sid\fR
and \fIvlan\fR.
.IP "\fBget\-aa\-mapping \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all of the Auto-Attach mappings within \fIbridge\fR on standard output.
.
.SS "Database Commands"
.
These commands query and modify the contents of \fBovsdb\fR tables.
They are a slight abstraction of the \fBovsdb\fR interface and as such
they operate at a lower level than other \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands.
.PP
.ST "Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns"
.PP
Each of these commands has a \fItable\fR parameter to identify a table
within the database.  Many of them also take a \fIrecord\fR parameter
that identifies a particular record within a table.  The \fIrecord\fR
parameter may be the UUID for a record, and many tables offer
additional ways to identify records.  Some commands also take
\fIcolumn\fR parameters that identify a particular field within the
records in a table.
.PP
For a list of tables and their columns, see \fBovs-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) or
see the table listing from the \fB--help\fR option.
.PP
Record names must be specified in full and with correct
capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first 4
(or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table.
Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and \fB\-\fR and
\fB_\fR are treated interchangeably.  Unique abbreviations of table
and column names are acceptable, e.g. \fBnet\fR or \fBn\fR is
sufficient to identify the \fBNetFlow\fR table.
.
.ST "Database Values"
.PP
Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data.  The
currently defined basic types, and their representations, are:
.IP "integer"
A decimal integer in the range \-2**63 to 2**63\-1, inclusive.
.IP "real"
A floating-point number.
.IP "Boolean"
True or false, written \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR, respectively.
.IP "string"
An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are not allowed.
Quotes are optional for most strings that begin with an English letter
or underscore and consist only of letters, underscores, hyphens, and
periods.  However, \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR and strings that match
the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes to
distinguish them from other basic types.  When double quotes are used,
the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to
escape special characters.  The empty string must be represented as a
pair of double quotes (\fB""\fR).
.IP "UUID"
Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122,
e.g. \fBf81d4fae\-7dec\-11d0\-a765\-00a0c91e6bf6\fR, or an \fB@\fIname\fR
defined by a \fBget\fR or \fBcreate\fR command within the same \fB\*(PN\fR
invocation.
.PP
Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a
single comma.  When multiple values are present, duplicates are not
allowed, and order is not important.  Conversely, some database
columns can have an empty set of values, represented as \fB[]\fR, and
square brackets may optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single
values as well. For a column accepting a set of integers, database commands
accept a range. A range is represented by two integers separated by
\fB-\fR. A range is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of 4096
elements. If more elements are needed, they can be specified in separate
ranges.
.PP
A few database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where the key
and the value are each some fixed database type.  These are specified
in the form \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR, where \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR
follow the syntax for the column's key type and value type,
respectively.  When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or
a comma), duplicate keys are not allowed, and again the order is not
important.  Duplicate values are allowed.  An empty map is represented
as \fB{}\fR.  Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty maps as
well (but use quotes to prevent the shell from expanding
\fBother-config={0=x,1=y}\fR into \fBother-config=0=x
other-config=1=y\fR, which may not have the desired effect).

\fIvalue\fR or, if \fIkey\fR is specified, whose \fIcolumn\fR contains
a \fIkey\fR with the specified \fIvalue\fR.  The following operators
may be used where \fB=\fR is written in the syntax summary:
.RS
.IP "\fB= != < > <= >=\fR"
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] equals, does not
equal, is less than, is greater than, is less than or equal to, or is
greater than or equal to \fIvalue\fR, respectively.
.IP
Consider \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] and \fIvalue\fR as sets of
elements.  Identical sets are considered equal.  Otherwise, if the
sets have different numbers of elements, then the set with more
elements is considered to be larger.  Otherwise, consider a element
from each set pairwise, in increasing order within each set.  The
first pair that differs determines the result.  (For a column that
contains key-value pairs, first all the keys are compared, and values
are considered only if the two sets contain identical keys.)
.IP "\fB{=} {!=}\fR"
Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.
.IP "\fB{<=}\fR"
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] is a subset of
\fIvalue\fR.  For example, \fBflood-vlans{<=}1,2\fR selects records in
which the \fBflood-vlans\fR column is the empty set or contains 1 or 2
or both.
.IP "\fB{<}\fR"
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] is a proper
subset of \fIvalue\fR.  For example, \fBflood-vlans{<}1,2\fR selects
records in which the \fBflood-vlans\fR column is the empty set or
contains 1 or 2 but not both.
.IP "\fB{>=} {>}\fR"
Same as \fB{<=}\fR and \fB{<}\fR, respectively, except that the
relationship is reversed.  For example, \fBflood-vlans{>=}1,2\fR
selects records in which the \fBflood-vlans\fR column contains both 1
and 2.

The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch 2.16 and
later:
.IP "\fB{in}\fR"

Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from \fIcolumn\fR in

are not maps: each specified \fIvalue\fR is removed from the column.
The second and third forms apply to map columns: if only a \fIkey\fR

removed, regardless of its value; if a \fIvalue\fR is given then a
pair is removed only if both key and value match.

.IP "Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)"
Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only when they
can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR
table.  Except for records in the \fBQoS\fR or \fBQueue\fR tables,
records that are not reachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are
automatically deleted from the database.  This deletion happens
immediately, without waiting for additional \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands
or other database activity.  Thus, a \fBcreate\fR command must
generally be accompanied by additional commands \fIwithin the same
\fBovs\-vsctl\fI invocation\fR to add a chain of references to the
newly created record from the top-level \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR record.
The \fBEXAMPLES\fR section gives some examples that show how to do
this.

The \fBdestroy\fR command is only useful for records in the \fBQoS\fR
or \fBQueue\fR tables.  Records in other tables are automatically
deleted from the database when they become unreachable from the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table.  This means that deleting the last reference
to a record is sufficient for deleting the record itself.  For records
in these tables, \fBdestroy\fR is silently ignored.  See the
\fBEXAMPLES\fR section below for more information.

Usually \fBwait\-until\fR should be placed at the beginning of a set
