NAME
       ovs-pki - OpenFlow public key infrastructure management utility


SYNOPSIS
       Each command takes the form:

       ovs-pki [options] command [args]

       The implemented commands and their arguments are:
       ovs-pki init
       ovs-pki req name
       ovs-pki sign name [type]
       ovs-pki req+sign name [type]
       ovs-pki verify name [type]
       ovs-pki fingerprint file
       ovs-pki self-sign name

       Each  type above is a certificate type, either switch (default) or con‐
       troller.

       The available options are:
       [-k type | --key=type]
       [-B nbits | --bits=nbits]
       [-D file | --dsaparam=file]
       [-b | --batch]
       [-f | --force]
       [-d dir | --dir=dir]
       [-l file | --log=file]
       [-h | --help]

       Some options do not apply to every command.


DESCRIPTION
       The ovs-pki program sets up and manages a public key infrastructure for
       use with OpenFlow.  It is intended to be a simple interface for organi‐
       zations that do not have  an  established  public  key  infrastructure.
       Other PKI tools can substitute for or supplement the use of ovs-pki.

       ovs-pki uses openssl(1) for certificate management and key generation.


OFFLINE COMMANDS
       The following ovs-pki commands support manual PKI administration:


       init   Initializes  a  new  PKI (by default in directory /var/lib/open‐
              vswitch/pki) and populates it with a pair of certificate author‐
              ities for controllers and switches.

              This  command  should  ideally be run on a high-security machine
              separate from any OpenFlow controller or switch, called  the  CA
              machine.      The    files    pki/controllerca/cacert.pem    and
              pki/switchca/cacert.pem that it produces will need to be  copied
              over  to  the  OpenFlow  switches and controllers, respectively.
              Their contents may safely be made public.

              By default, ovs-pki generates 2048-bit  RSA  keys.   The  -B  or
              --bits  option  (see  below)  may  be  used  to override the key
              length.  The -k dsa or --key=dsa option may be used to  use  DSA
              in place of RSA.  If DSA is selected, the dsaparam.pem file gen‐
              erated in the new PKI hierarchy must be copied to any machine on
              which  the  req  command (see below) will be executed.  Its con‐
              tents may safely be made public.

              Other files generated by init may remain on the CA machine.  The
              files  pki/controllerca/private/cakey.pem  and pki/switchca/pri‐
              vate/cakey.pem have particularly sensitive contents that  should
              not be exposed.


       req name
              Generates  a  new  private key named name-privkey.pem and corre‐
              sponding certificate request named  name-req.pem.   The  private
              key can be intended for use by a switch or a controller.

              This  command  should ideally be run on the switch or controller
              that will use the private key  to  identify  itself.   The  file
              name-req.pem  must  be copied to the CA machine for signing with
              the sign command (below).

              This command will output a fingerprint to stdout  as  its  final
              step.   Write down the fingerprint and take it to the CA machine
              before continuing with the sign step.

              When RSA keys are in use (as is the default),  req,  unlike  the
              rest  of ovs-pki's commands, does not need access to a PKI hier‐
              archy created by ovs-pki init.  The -B  or  --bits  option  (see
              below)  may  be used to specify the number of bits in the gener‐
              ated RSA key.

              When DSA keys are used (as specified with --key=dsa), req  needs
              access to the dsaparam.pem file created as part of the PKI hier‐
              archy (but not to  other  files  in  that  tree).   By  default,
              ovs-pki     looks    for    this    file    in    /var/lib/open‐
              vswitch/pki/dsaparam.pem, but the -D or --dsaparam  option  (see
              below) may be used to specify an alternate location.

              name-privkey.pem  has  sensitive  contents  that  should  not be
              exposed.  name-req.pem may be safely made public.


       sign name [type]
              Signs the certificate request named name-req.pem that  was  pro‐
              duced  in  the  previous  step,  producing  a  certificate named
              name-cert.pem.  type, either  switch  (default)  or  controller,
              indicates the use for which the key is being certified.

              This command must be run on the CA machine.

              The command will output a fingerprint to stdout and request that
              you verify that it is the same fingerprint  output  by  the  req
              command.  This ensures that the request being signed is the same
              one produced by req.  (The -b or --batch option  suppresses  the
              verification step.)

              The file name-cert.pem will need to be copied back to the switch
              or controller for which it is intended.  Its contents may safely
              be made public.


       req+sign name [type]
              Combines  the  req  and  sign  commands into a single step, out‐
              putting all the files produced by  each.   The  name-privkey.pem
              and name-cert.pem files must be copied securely to the switch or
              controller.  name-privkey.pem has sensitive  contents  and  must
              not be exposed in transit.  Afterward, it should be deleted from
              the CA machine.

              This combined method is, theoretically,  less  secure  than  the
              individual steps performed separately on two different machines,
              because there is additional potential for exposure of  the  pri‐
              vate key.  However, it is also more convenient.


       verify name [type]
              Verifies that name-cert.pem is a valid certificate for the given
              type of use, either switch (default) or controller.  If the cer‐
              tificate   is   valid  for  this  use,  it  prints  the  message
              ``name-cert.pem: OK''; otherwise, it prints an error message.


       fingerprint file
              Prints the fingerprint for file.  If file is a certificate, then
              this  is the SHA-1 digest of the DER encoded version of the cer‐
              tificate; otherwise, it is the SHA-1 digest of the entire file.


       self-sign name
              Signs the certificate request named name-req.pem using the  pri‐
              vate  key  name-privkey.pem, producing a self-signed certificate
              named name-cert.pem.  The input files should have been  produced
              with ovs-pki req.

              Some controllers accept such self-signed certificates.


OPTIONS
       -k type
       --key=type
              For  the  init command, sets the public key algorithm to use for
              the new PKI hierarchy.  For the req and req+sign commands,  sets
              the  public  key  algorithm  to use for the key to be generated,
              which must match the value specified on init.  With  other  com‐
              mands, the value has no effect.

              The type may be rsa (the default) or dsa.


       -B nbits
       --bits=nbits
              Sets  the  number  of bits in the key to be generated.  When RSA
              keys are in use, this option affects only  the  init,  req,  and
              req+sign commands, and the same value should be given each time.
              With DSA keys are in use, this option affects only the init com‐
              mand.

              The value must be at least 1024.  The default is 2048.


       -D file
       --dsaparam=file
              Specifies  an  alternate  location  for  the  dsaparam.pem  file
              required by the req and req+sign commands.  This option  affects
              only these commands, and only when DSA keys are used.

              The default is dsaparam.pem under the PKI hierarchy.


       -b
       --batch
              Suppresses the interactive verification of fingerprints that the
              sign command by default requires.


       -d dir
       --dir=dir
              Specifies the location of the PKI hierarchy to be used  or  cre‐
              ated  by  the  command (default: /var/lib/openvswitch/pki).  All
              commands, except req, need access to a PKI hierarchy.


       -f
       --force
              By default, ovs-pki will not overwrite existing files or  direc‐
              tories.  This option overrides this behavior.


       -l file
       --log=file
              Sets   the   log   file   to   file.    Default:  /var/log/open‐
              vswitch/ovs-pki.log.


       -h
       --help Prints a help usage message and exits.
