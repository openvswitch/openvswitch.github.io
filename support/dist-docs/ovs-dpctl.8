.SH NAME
ovs\-dpctl \- administer Open vSwitch datapaths
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ovs\-dpctl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIswitch\fR] [\fIargs\fR\&...]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBovs\-dpctl\fR program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch
datapaths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.
.PP
A newly created datapath is associated with only one network device, a
virtual network device sometimes called the datapath's ``local port''.
A newly created datapath is not, however, associated with any of the
host's other network devices.  To intercept and process traffic on a
given network device, use the \fBadd\-if\fR command to explicitly add
that network device to the datapath.
.PP
If \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR(8) is in use, use \fBovs\-vsctl\fR(8) instead
of \fBovs\-dpctl\fR.
.PP
Most \fBovs\-dpctl\fR commands that work with datapaths take an
argument that specifies the name of the datapath.  Datapath names take
the form [\fItype\fB@\fR]\fIname\fR, where \fIname\fR is the network
device associated with the datapath's local port.  If \fItype\fR is
given, it specifies the datapath provider of \fIname\fR, otherwise the
default provider \fBsystem\fR is assumed.
.PP
The following commands manage datapaths.
.
.ds DX
.de DO
\\$1 \\$2 \\$3
..
.TP
\*(DX\fBadd\-dp \fIdp\fR [\fInetdev\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]...]
Creates datapath \fIdp\fR, with a local port also named \fIdp\fR.
This will fail if a network device \fIdp\fR already exists.
.IP
If \fInetdev\fRs are specified, \fB\*(PN\fR adds them to the
new datapath, just as if \fBadd\-if\fR was specified.
.
.TP
\*(DX\fBdel\-dp \fIdp\fR
Deletes datapath \fIdp\fR.  If \fIdp\fR is associated with any network
devices, they are automatically removed.
.
.TP
\*(DX\fBadd\-if \fIdp netdev\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]...
Adds each \fInetdev\fR to the set of network devices datapath
\fIdp\fR monitors, where \fIdp\fR is the name of an existing
datapath, and \fInetdev\fR is the name of one of the host's
network devices, e.g. \fBeth0\fR.  Once a network device has been added
to a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the network device's
traffic and the network device appears silent to the rest of the
system.
.IP
A \fInetdev\fR may be followed by a comma-separated list of options.
The following options are currently supported:
.
.RS
.IP "\fBtype=\fItype\fR"
Specifies the type of port to add.  The default type is \fBsystem\fR.
.IP "\fBport_no=\fIport\fR"
Requests a specific port number within the datapath.  If this option is
not specified then one will be automatically assigned.
.IP "\fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR"
Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's configuration.
.RE
.IP
\fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) documents the available port types and
options.
.
.IP "\*(DX\fBset\-if \fIdp port\fR[\fB,\fIoption\fR]..."
Reconfigures each \fIport\fR in \fIdp\fR as specified.  An
\fIoption\fR of the form \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR adds the specified
key-value option to the port or overrides an existing key's value.  An
\fIoption\fR of the form \fIkey\fB=\fR, that is, without a value,
deletes the key-value named \fIkey\fR.  The type and port number of a
port cannot be changed, so \fBtype\fR and \fBport_no\fR are only allowed if
they match the existing configuration.
.TP
\*(DX\fBdel\-if \fIdp netdev\fR...
Removes each \fInetdev\fR from the list of network devices datapath
\fIdp\fR monitors.
.
.TP
\*(DX\fBdump\-dps\fR
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.
.
.TP
.DO "[\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-statistics\fR]" "\*(DX\fBshow" "\fR[\fIdp\fR...]"
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their datapath
numbers and a list of ports connected to each datapath.  (The local
port is identified as port 0.)  If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR
is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for each
port.
.IP
The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow mask stats.
.IP
The "lookups" row displays three stats related to flow lookup triggered
by processing incoming packets in the datapath. "hit" displays number
of packets matches existing flows. "missed" displays the number of
packets not matching any existing flow and require user space processing.
"lost" displays number of packets destined for user space process but
subsequently dropped before reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss"
equals to the total number of packets datapath processed.
.IP
The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.
.IP
The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is omitted
for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit" displays the total number
of masks visited for matching incoming packets. "total" displays number of
masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" displays the average number of masks
visited per packet; the ratio between "hit" and total number of
packets processed by the datapath".
.IP
If one or more datapaths are specified, information on only those
datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, \fB\*(PN\fR displays information
about all configured datapaths.
.SS "DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING COMMANDS"
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open
vSwitch.  The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that they
work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different
and considerably simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel
module.  Use \fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8), instead, to work with OpenFlow flow
entries.
.
.PP
The \fIdp\fR argument to each of these commands is optional when
exactly one datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the
default.  When multiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is
required.
.
.TP
.DO "[\fB\-m \fR| \fB\-\-more\fR]" \*(DX\fBdump\-flows\fR "[\fIdp\fR] [\fBfilter=\fIfilter\fR]"
Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath \fIdp\fR's flow
table.  Without \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-\-more\fR, output omits match fields
that a flow wildcards entirely; with \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-\-more\fR,
output includes all wildcarded fields.
.IP
If \fBfilter=\fIfilter\fR is specified, only displays the flows
that match the \fIfilter\fR. \fIfilter\fR is a flow in the form similiar
to that accepted by \fBovs\-ofctl\fR(8)'s \fBadd\-flow\fR command. (This is
not an OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it never contains wildcards.)
The \fIfilter\fR is also useful to match wildcarded fields in the datapath
flow. As an example, \fBfilter='tcp,tp_src=100'\fR will match the
datapath flow containing '\fBtcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)\fR'.
.
.IP "\*(DX\fBadd\-flow\fR [\fIdp\fR] \fIflow actions\fR"
.TP
.DO "[\fB\-\-clear\fR] [\fB\-\-may-create\fR] [\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-statistics\fR]" "\*(DX\fBmod\-flow\fR" "[\fIdp\fR] \fIflow actions\fR"
Adds or modifies a flow in \fIdp\fR's flow table that, when a packet
matching \fIflow\fR arrives, causes \fIactions\fR to be executed.
.IP
The \fBadd\-flow\fR command succeeds only if \fIflow\fR does not
already exist in \fIdp\fR.  Contrariwise, \fBmod\-flow\fR without
\fB\-\-may\-create\fR only modifies the actions for an existing flow.
With \fB\-\-may\-create\fR, \fBmod\-flow\fR will add a new flow or
modify an existing one.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR is specified, then
\fBmod\-flows\fR prints the modified flow's statistics.  A flow's
statistics are the number of packets and bytes that have passed
through the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags
processed through the flow.
.IP
With \fB\-\-clear\fR, \fBmod\-flows\fR zeros out the flow's
statistics.  The statistics printed if \fB\-s\fR or
\fB\-\-statistics\fR is also specified are those from just before
clearing the statistics.
.
.TP
.DO "[\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-statistics\fR]" "\*(DX\fBdel\-flow\fR" "[\fIdp\fR] \fIflow\fR"
Deletes the flow from \fIdp\fR's flow table that matches \fIflow\fR.
If \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-statistics\fR is specified, then
\fBmod\-flows\fR prints the deleted flow's statistics.
.
.IP "\*(DX\fBdel\-flows\fR [\fIdp\fR]"
Deletes all flow entries from datapath \fIdp\fR's flow table.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-s\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-statistics\fR"
Causes the \fBshow\fR command to print packet and byte counters for
each port within the datapaths that it shows.
.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-more\fR"
Increases the verbosity of \fBdump\-flows\fR output.
.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fR"
Limits \fBovs\-dpctl\fR runtime to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds.  If
the timeout expires, \fBovs\-dpctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR
signal.

.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and facility to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIfacility\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
