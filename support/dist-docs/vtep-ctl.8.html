<u>vtep-ctl</u>(8)                   Open vSwitch Manual                  <u>vtep-ctl</u>(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       vtep-ctl - utility for querying and configuring a VTEP database

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>vtep-ctl</b>  [<u>options</u>]  <b>--</b>  [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>args</u>] [<b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u>
       [<u>args</u>]]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>vtep-ctl</b> program configures a VTEP database.  See <b>vtep</b>(5) for  com‐
       prehensive documentation of the database schema.

       <b>vtep-ctl</b> connects to an <b>ovsdb-server</b> process that maintains a VTEP con‐
       figuration  database.   Using  this connection, it queries and possibly
       applies changes to the database, depending on the supplied commands.

       <b>vtep-ctl</b> can perform any number of commands in  a  single  run,  imple‐
       mented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The <b>vtep-ctl</b> command line begins with global options (see <b>OPTIONS</b> below
       for details).  The global options are followed by one or more commands.
       Each command should begin with <b>--</b> by itself as a command-line argument,
       to  separate  it from the following commands.  (The <b>--</b> before the first
       command is optional.)  The command itself starts with  command-specific
       options,  if  any, followed by the command name and any arguments.  See
       <b>EXAMPLES</b> below for syntax examples.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       The following options affect the behavior <b>vtep-ctl</b> as  a  whole.   Some
       individual commands also accept their own options, which are given just
       before  the command name.  If the first command on the command line has
       options, then those options must be separated from the  global  options
       by <b>--</b>.

       <b>--db=</b><u>server</u>
              Sets  <u>server</u>  as  the  database server that <b>vtep-ctl</b> contacts to
              query or modify configuration.  <u>server</u> may be an OVSDB active or
              passive connection method, as described in  <b>ovsdb</b>(7).   The  de‐
              fault is <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>--no-syslog</b>
              By  default,  <b>vtep-ctl</b> logs its arguments and the details of any
              changes that it makes to the system log.  This  option  disables
              this logging.

              This option is equivalent to <b>--verbose=vtep_ctl:syslog:warn</b>.

       <b>--oneline</b>
              Modifies  the  output format so that the output for each command
              is printed on a single line.   New-line  characters  that  would
              otherwise separate lines are printed as <b>\n</b>, and any instances of
              <b>\</b> that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.  Prints
              a  blank  line for each command that has no output.  This option
              does not affect the formatting of output from the <b>list</b>  or  <b>find</b>
              commands; see <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> below.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Prevents <b>vtep-ctl</b> from actually modifying the database.

       <b>-t</b> <u>secs</u>
       <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              By  default,  or  with a <u>secs</u> of <b>0</b>, <b>vtep-ctl</b> waits forever for a
              response from the database.  This option limits runtime  to  ap‐
              proximately <u>secs</u> seconds.  If the timeout expires, <b>vtep-ctl</b> will
              exit  with  a  <b>SIGALRM</b> signal.  (A timeout would normally happen
              only if the database cannot be contacted, or if  the  system  is
              overloaded.)

   <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b>
       These  options control the format of output from the <b>list</b> and <b>find</b> com‐
       mands.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
              Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of  <u>for‐</u>
              <u>mat</u> are available:

              <b>table</b>  2-D text tables with aligned columns.

              <b>list</b> (default)
                     A  list  with one column per line and rows separated by a
                     blank line.

              <b>html</b>   HTML tables.

              <b>csv</b>    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

              <b>json</b>   JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a  se‐
                     quence  of JSON objects, each of which corresponds to one
                     table.  Each JSON object has the following  members  with
                     the noted values:

                     <b>caption</b>
                            The  table's  caption.   This member is omitted if
                            the table has no caption.

                     <b>headings</b>
                            An array with one element per table column.   Each
                            array element is a string giving the corresponding
                            column's heading.

                     <b>data</b>   An array with one element per table row.  Each el‐
                            ement  is also an array with one element per table
                            column.  The elements of this  second-level  array
                            are  the  cells  that constitute the table.  Cells
                            that represent OVSDB data or data  types  are  ex‐
                            pressed in the format described in the OVSDB spec‐
                            ification;  other  cells  are  simply expressed as
                            text strings.

       <b>-d</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--data=</b><u>format</u>
              Sets the formatting for cells within output  tables  unless  the
              table  format  is  set to <b>json</b>, in which case <b>json</b> formatting is
              always used when formatting cells.  The following types of  <u>for‐</u>
              <u>mat</u> are available:

              <b>string</b> (default)
                     The  simple  format described in the <b>Database</b> <b>Values</b> sec‐
                     tion of <b>ovs-vsctl</b>(8).

              <b>bare</b>   The simple format with punctuation stripped off:  <b>[]</b>  and
                     <b>{}</b>  are  omitted  around  sets,  maps, and empty columns,
                     items within  sets  and  maps  are  space-separated,  and
                     strings  are never quoted.  This format may be easier for
                     scripts to parse.

              <b>json</b>   The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

       <b>--no-headings</b>
              This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in
              the first row of table output.

       <b>--pretty</b>
              By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as  possible.
              This  option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more read‐
              able fashion.  Members of objects and  elements  of  arrays  are
              printed one per line, with indentation.

              This  option  does  not  affect  JSON in tables, which is always
              printed compactly.

       <b>--bare</b> Equivalent to <b>--format=list</b> <b>--data=bare</b> <b>--no-headings</b>.

       <b>--max-column-width=</b><u>n</u>
              For table output only, limits the width of  any  column  in  the
              output  to  <u>n</u> columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to fit, as
              necessary.  Columns are always wide enough to display the column
              names, if the heading row is printed.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that <b>vtep-ctl</b>
              should use to verify certificates presented  to  it  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use
              to  verify  the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>, or
              it may be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.   This  introduces a security risk, because it means that
              certificates cannot be verified to be  those  of  known  trusted
              hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              When <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--ca-cert</b>.   If it does not exist, then <b>vtep-ctl</b> will attempt to
              obtain the CA certificate from the SSL/TLS  peer  on  its  first
              SSL/TLS  connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is
              successful, it will immediately drop the connection  and  recon‐
              nect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be authenti‐
              cated  by  a  certificate  signed by the CA certificate thus ob‐
              tained.

              <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b>  <b>man-in-the-mid‐</b>
              <b>dle</b>  <b>attack</b>  <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be
              useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA cer‐
              tificate as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS pro‐
              tocols do not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL/TLS peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should be
              the CA certificate used to sign <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s own certificate, that
              is, the  certificate  specified  on  <b>-c</b>  or  <b>--certificate</b>.   If
              <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s  certificate  is  self-signed, then <b>--certificate</b> and
              <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This option is not  useful  in  normal  operation,  because  the
              SSL/TLS  peer  must already have the CA certificate for the peer
              to have any confidence in <b>vtep-ctl</b>'s  identity.   However,  this
              offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap the CA certifi‐
              cate on its first SSL/TLS connection.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.  (If <b>--detach</b> is specified, <b>vtep-ctl</b> closes
                     its standard file descriptors, so logging to the  console
                     will have no effect.)

                     On  Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  <b>--syslog-target</b>  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>,  <b>emer</b>,  <b>err</b>,  <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  <b>off</b> filters out all  messages.   See  <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to <u>pattern</u>.  Refer to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message.  <u>facility</u>  can  be
              one  of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>,  <b>local1</b>,  <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>,  <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not
              specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for  the  local  system
              syslog  and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables logging to a file.  If <u>file</u> is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name  used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is   <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/vtep-ctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options  is  that libc adds fixed prefix to every message
                     before it is actually sent  to  the  syslog  daemon  over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However,  <b>rsyslogd</b>  <b>8.9</b> and older versions use hard coded
                     parser function anyway that  limits  UNIX  domain  socket
                     use.   If  you  want to use arbitrary message format with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible to use arbitrary message  format  also  with  older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.   When  sending syslog messages over UDP socket
                     extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for  ex‐
                     ample,  syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
                     the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could
                     be  interfering  with  local syslog traffic and there are
                     some security considerations that apply to  UDP  sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The  default  is  taken  from  the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>COMMANDS</b>
       The commands implemented by <b>vtep-ctl</b> are described in the sections  be‐
       low.

   <b>Physical</b> <b>Switch</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate physical switches.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-ps</b> <u>pswitch</u>
              Creates  a  new  physical  switch  named <u>pswitch</u>.  Initially the
              switch will have no ports.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a switch  that  exists
              is  an  error.   With  <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if
              <u>pswitch</u> already exists.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-ps</b> <u>pswitch</u>
              Deletes <u>pswitch</u> and all of its ports.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a switch that does not
              exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>,  attempting  to  delete  a
              switch that does not exist has no effect.

       <b>list-ps</b>
              Lists all existing physical switches on standard output, one per

   <b>Port</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate VTEP physical ports.

       <b>list-ports</b> <u>pswitch</u>
              Lists  all  of  the ports within <u>pswitch</u> on standard output, one
              per line.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-port</b> <u>pswitch</u> <u>port</u>
              Creates on <u>pswitch</u> a new port named <u>port</u> from the network device
              of the same name.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a port that exists  is
              an  error.   With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if <u>port</u>
              already exists on <u>pswitch</u>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-port</b> [<u>pswitch</u>] <u>port</u>
              Deletes <u>port</u>.  If <u>pswitch</u> is omitted, <u>port</u> is removed from what‐
              ever switch contains it; if <u>pswitch</u> is specified, it must be the
              switch that contains <u>port</u>.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a port that  does  not
              exist  is  an  error.   With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a
              port that does not exist has no effect.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Switch</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate logical switches.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-ls</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              Creates a new  logical  switch  named  <u>lswitch</u>.   Initially  the
              switch will have no locator bindings.

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>,  attempting to create a switch that exists
              is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this  command  does  nothing  if

       <b>list-ls</b>
              Lists all existing logical switches on standard output, one  per
              line.

       <b>ls-exists</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              Tests  whether  <u>lswitch</u>  exists.  If so, <b>vtep-ctl</b> exits success‐
              fully with exit code 0.  If not, <b>vtep-ctl</b>  exits  unsuccessfully
              with exit code 2.

       <b>bind-ls</b> <u>pswitch</u> <u>port</u> <u>vlan</u> <u>lswitch</u>

              physical switch <u>pswitch</u>.

       <b>unbind-ls</b> <u>pswitch</u> <u>port</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Remove the logical switch binding from the <u>port</u>/<u>vlan</u> combination
              on the physical switch <u>pswitch</u>.

       <b>list-bindings</b> <u>pswitch</u> <u>port</u>
              List the logical switch bindings for <u>port</u> on the physical switch
              <u>pswitch</u>.

       <b>set-replication-mode</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>replication-mode</u>
              Set logical switch <u>lswitch</u> replication mode to <u>replication-mode</u>;
              the only valid values for replication  mode  are  "service_node"
              and "source_node".  For handling L2 broadcast, multicast and un‐
              known  unicast  traffic, packets can be sent to all members of a
              logical switch referenced by a physical switch.  There are  dif‐
              ferent  modes  to  replicate  the  packets.  The default mode of
              replication is to send the traffic to a service node, which  can
              be  a  hypervisor, server or appliance, and let the service node
              handle replication to  other  transport  nodes  (hypervisors  or
              other VTEP physical switches).  This mode is called service node
              replication.   An  alternate  mode of replication, called source
              node replication involves the source node sending to  all  other
              transport  nodes.   Hypervisors are always responsible for doing
              their own replication for locally attached VMs  in  both  modes.
              Service node mode is the default, if the replication mode is not
              explicitly  set.   Service node replication mode is considered a
              basic requirement because it only requires sending the packet to
              a single transport node.

       <b>get-replication-mode</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              Get logical switch <u>lswitch</u> replication  mode.   The  only  valid
              values    for    replication   mode   are   "service_node"   and
              "source_node".  An empty reply for replication  mode  implies  a
              default of "service_node".

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Router</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate logical routers.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-lr</b> <u>lrouter</u>
              Creates a new logical router named <u>lrouter</u>.

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>,  attempting to create a router that exists
              is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this  command  does  nothing  if

              fully with exit code 0.  If not, <b>vtep-ctl</b>  exits  unsuccessfully
              with exit code 2.


   <b>Local</b> <b>MAC</b> <b>Binding</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These  commands examine and manipulate local MAC bindings for the logi‐
       cal switch.  The local maps are written by the VTEP to refer to MACs it
       has learned on its physical ports.

       <b>add-ucast-local</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u> [<u>encap</u>] <u>ip</u>
              Map the unicast Ethernet address <u>mac</u> to the physical location <u>ip</u>
              using encapsulation <u>encap</u> on <u>lswitch</u>.  If <u>encap</u>  is  not  speci‐
              fied,  the default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The local mappings are
              used by the VTEP to refer to MACs learned on its physical ports.

       <b>del-ucast-local</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u>
              Remove the local unicast Ethernet address <u>mac</u> map from  <u>lswitch</u>.
              The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to MACs learned
              on its physical ports.

       <b>add-mcast-local</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u> [<u>encap</u>] <u>ip</u>
              Add  physical location <u>ip</u> using encapsulation <u>encap</u> to the local
              mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address <u>mac</u> on <u>lswitch</u>.
              If <u>encap</u> is not specified,  the  default  is  "vxlan_over_ipv4".
              The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to MACs learned
              on its physical ports.

       <b>del-mcast-local</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u> [<u>encap</u>] <u>ip</u>
              Remove  physical  location <u>ip</u> using encapsulation <u>encap</u> from the
              local mac binding table for multicast Ethernet  address  <u>mac</u>  on
              <u>lswitch</u>.    If   <u>encap</u>   is   not   specified,  the  default  is
              "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The local mappings are used by the  VTEP  to
              refer to MACs learned on its physical ports.

       <b>clear-local-macs</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              Clear the local MAC bindings for <u>lswitch</u>.

       <b>list-local-macs</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              List the local MAC bindings for <u>lswitch</u>, one per line.

   <b>Remote</b> <b>MAC</b> <b>Binding</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate local and remote MAC bindings for
       the  logical switch.  The remote maps are written by the network virtu‐
       alization controller to refer to MACs that it has learned.

       <b>add-ucast-remote</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u> [<u>encap</u>] <u>ip</u>
              Map the unicast Ethernet address <u>mac</u> to the physical location <u>ip</u>
              using encapsulation <u>encap</u> on <u>lswitch</u>.  If <u>encap</u>  is  not  speci‐
              fied, the default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The remote mappings are
              used  by  the  network  virtualization platform to refer to MACs
              that it has learned.

       <b>del-ucast-remote</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u>
              Remove the remote unicast Ethernet address <u>mac</u> map from <u>lswitch</u>.
              The remote mappings are used by the network virtualization plat‐
              form to refer to MACs that it has learned.

       <b>add-mcast-remote</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u> [<u>encap</u>] <u>ip</u>
              Add physical location <u>ip</u> using encapsulation <u>encap</u> to the remote
              mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address <u>mac</u> on <u>lswitch</u>.
              If <u>encap</u> is not specified,  the  default  is  "vxlan_over_ipv4".
              The remote mappings are used by the network virtualization plat‐
              form to refer to MACs that it has learned.

       <b>del-mcast-remote</b> <u>lswitch</u> <u>mac</u> [<u>encap</u>] <u>ip</u>
              Remove  physical  location <u>ip</u> using encapsulation <u>encap</u> from the
              remote mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address  <u>mac</u>  on
              <u>lswitch</u>.    If   <u>encap</u>   is   not   specified,  the  default  is
              "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The remote mappings are used by the  network
              virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it has learned.

       <b>clear-remote-macs</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              Clear the remote MAC bindings for <u>lswitch</u>.

       <b>list-remote-macs</b> <u>lswitch</u>
              List the remote MAC bindings for <u>lswitch</u>, one per line.

   <b>Manager</b> <b>Connectivity</b>
       These  commands  manipulate the <b>managers</b> column in the <b>Global</b> table and
       rows in the <b>Managers</b> table.  When <b>ovsdb-server</b> is configured to use the
       <b>managers</b> column for OVSDB connections  (as  described  in  the  startup
       scripts  provided  with Open vSwitch), this allows the administrator to
       use <b>vtep-ctl</b> to configure database connections.

       <b>get-manager</b>
              Prints the configured manager(s).

       <b>del-manager</b>
              Deletes the configured manager(s).

       <b>set-manager</b> <u>target</u>...
              Sets the configured manager target or targets.  Each <u>target</u>  may
              be an OVSDB active or passive connection method, e.g. <b>pssl:6640</b>,
              as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

   <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb</b> tables.  They are
       a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb</b> interface and as such they operate at
       a lower level than other <b>vtep-ctl</b> commands.

     <u>Identifying</u> <u>Tables,</u> <u>Records,</u> <u>and</u> <u>Columns</u>

       Each of these commands has a <u>table</u> parameter to identify a table within
       the  database.   Many of them also take a <u>record</u> parameter that identi‐
       fies a particular record within a table.  The <u>record</u> parameter  may  be
       the  UUID  for a record, and many tables offer additional ways to iden‐
       tify records.  Some commands also take <u>column</u> parameters that  identify
       a particular field within the records in a table.

       The following tables are currently defined:

       <b>Global</b> Top-level  configuration  for  a hardware VTEP.  This table con‐
              tains exactly one record, identified  by  specifying  <b>.</b>  as  the
              record name.

       <b>Manager</b>
              Configuration  for  an OVSDB connection.  Records may be identi‐
              fied by target (e.g. <b>tcp:1.2.3.4</b>).

       <b>Physical_Switch</b>
              A physical switch that implements a VTEP.  Records may be  iden‐
              tified by physical switch name.

       <b>Physical_Port</b>
              A port within a physical switch.

       <b>Logical_Binding_Stats</b>
              Reports statistics for the logical switch with which a VLAN on a
              physical port is associated.

       <b>Logical_Switch</b>
              A logical Ethernet switch.  Records may be identified by logical
              switch name.

       <b>Ucast_Macs_Local</b>
              Mapping of locally discovered unicast MAC addresses to tunnels.

       <b>Ucast_Macs_Remote</b>
              Mapping of remotely programmed unicast MAC addresses to tunnels.

       <b>Mcast_Macs_Local</b>
              Mapping  of  locally  discovered multicast MAC addresses to tun‐
              nels.

       <b>Mcast_Macs_Remote</b>
              Mapping of remotely programmed multicast MAC addresses  to  tun‐
              nels.

       <b>Physical_Locator_Set</b>
              A set of one or more physical locators.

       <b>Physical_Locator</b>
              Identifies  an  endpoint  to which logical switch traffic may be
              encapsulated and forwarded.  Records may be identified by physi‐
              cal locator name.

       Record names must be specified in full and with correct capitalization,
       except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first  4  (or  more)  hex
       digits,  as  long  as that is unique within the table.  Names of tables
       and columns are not case-sensitive, and <b>-</b>  and  <b>_</b>  are  treated  inter‐
       changeably.  Unique abbreviations of table and column names are accept‐
       able, e.g. <b>man</b> or <b>m</b> is sufficient to identify the <b>Manager</b> table.

     <u>Database</u> <u>Values</u>

       Each  column  in  the  database accepts a fixed type of data.  The cur‐
       rently defined basic types, and their representations, are:

       integer
              A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1, inclusive.

       real   A floating-point number.

       Boolean
              True or false, written <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, respectively.

       string An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are not  al‐
              lowed.   Quotes are optional for most strings that begin with an
              English letter or underscore and consist only of letters, under‐
              scores, hyphens, and  periods.   However,  <b>true</b>  and  <b>false</b>  and
              strings  that  match the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be en‐
              closed in double quotes to distinguish  them  from  other  basic
              types.   When  double  quotes  are  used,  the syntax is that of
              strings in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to escape  special
              characters.   The  empty string must be represented as a pair of
              double quotes (<b>""</b>).

       UUID   Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122,
              e.g. <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>, or an  <b>@</b><u>name</u>  defined
              by a <b>get</b> or <b>create</b> command within the same <b>vtep-ctl</b> invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a sin‐
       gle  comma.   When  multiple values are present, duplicates are not al‐
       lowed, and order is not important.  Conversely, some  database  columns
       can have an empty set of values, represented as <b>[]</b>, and square brackets
       may  optionally  enclose other non-empty sets or single values as well.
       For a column accepting a set of integers, database  commands  accept  a
       range.  A  range is represented by two integers separated by <b>-</b>. A range
       is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of 4096 elements. If more ele‐
       ments are needed, they can be specified in separate ranges.

       A few database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where  the  key
       and  the  value are each some fixed database type.  These are specified
       in the form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, where <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> follow the  syntax  for  the
       column's  key  type  and value type, respectively.  When multiple pairs
       are present (separated by spaces or a comma), duplicate  keys  are  not
       allowed,  and  again  the order is not important.  Duplicate values are
       allowed.  An empty map is represented as <b>{}</b>.  Curly braces may  option‐
       ally  enclose  non-empty  maps  as  well (but use quotes to prevent the
       shell  from  expanding  <b>other-config={0=x,1=y}</b>  into   <b>other-config=0=x</b>
       <b>other-config=1=y</b>, which may not have the desired effect).

     <u>Database</u> <u>Command</u> <u>Syntax</u>

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>list</b> <u>table</u> [<u>record</u>]...
              Lists  the  data  in  each  specified <u>record</u>.  If no records are
              specified, lists all the records in <u>table</u>.

              If <b>--columns</b>  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns  are
              listed,  in  the  specified  order.   Otherwise, all columns are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if any specified <u>record</u> does
              not exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, the  command  ignores  any  <u>record</u>
              that does not exist, without producing any output.

       [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>find</b> <u>table</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
              Lists the data in each record in <u>table</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u>
              or,  if  <u>key</u>  is specified, whose <u>column</u> contains a <u>key</u> with the
              specified <u>value</u>.  The following operators may be used where <b>=</b> is
              written in the syntax summary:

              <b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>
                     Selects records in which <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  equals,  does  not
                     equal,  is  less  than,  is greater than, is less than or
                     equal to, or is greater than or equal to  <u>value</u>,  respec‐
                     tively.

                     Consider  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  and  <u>value</u>  as  sets of elements.
                     Identical sets are considered equal.  Otherwise,  if  the
                     sets  have  different  numbers  of elements, then the set
                     with more elements is considered to  be  larger.   Other‐
                     wise,  consider  a element from each set pairwise, in in‐
                     creasing order within each set.  The first pair that dif‐
                     fers determines the result.  (For a column that  contains
                     key-value  pairs,  first  all  the keys are compared, and
                     values are considered only if the two sets contain  iden‐
                     tical keys.)

              <b>{=}</b> <b>{!=}</b>
                     Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

              <b>{&lt;=}</b>   Selects  records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is a subset of
                     <u>value</u>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2</b>  selects  records
                     in  which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty set or con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 or both.

              <b>{&lt;}</b>    Selects records in which <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is a proper  subset
                     of <u>value</u>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2</b> selects records
                     in  which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty set or con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 but not both.

              <b>{&gt;=}</b> <b>{&gt;}</b>
                     Same as <b>{&lt;=}</b> and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except that the rela‐
                     tionship is reversed.   For  example,  <b>flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2</b>
                     selects  records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column contains
                     both 1 and 2.

              The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch  2.16
              and later:

              <b>{in}</b>   Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is
                     also in <u>value</u>.  (This is the same as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

              <b>{not-in}</b>
                     Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is
                     not in <u>value</u>.

              For arithmetic operators (<b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>), when <u>key</u> is specified
              but  a  particular  record's  <u>column</u>  does  not contain <u>key</u>, the
              record is always omitted from the results.  Thus, the  condition
              <b>other-config:mtu!=1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose
              value is not 1500, but not those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

              For  the  set  operators, when <u>key</u> is specified but a particular
              record's <u>column</u> does not contain <u>key</u>,  the  comparison  is  done
              against   an   empty   set.    Thus,  the  condition  <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:mtu{!=}1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose  value
              is not 1500 and those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

              Don't forget to escape <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> from interpretation by the shell.

              If  <b>--columns</b>  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns are
              listed, in the  specified  order.   Otherwise  all  columns  are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same <b>vtep-ctl</b> invocation
              will be wrong.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><u>name</u>] <b>get</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]]...
              Prints the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in
              <u>table</u>.   For  map columns, a <u>key</u> may optionally be specified, in
              which case the value  associated  with  <u>key</u>  in  the  column  is
              printed, instead of the entire map.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist or
              <u>key</u> is specified,  if  <u>key</u>  does  not  exist  in  <u>record</u>.   With
              <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <u>record</u> yields no output and a missing <u>key</u>
              prints a blank line.

              If  <b>@</b><u>name</u> is specified, then the UUID for <u>record</u> may be referred
              to by that name later in the same <b>vtep-ctl</b>  invocation  in  con‐
              texts where a UUID is expected.

              Both  <b>--id</b> and the <u>column</u> arguments are optional, but usually at
              least one or the other should be specified.  If both  are  omit‐
              ted,  then <b>get</b> has no effect except to verify that <u>record</u> exists
              in <u>table</u>.

              <b>--id</b> and <b>--if-exists</b> cannot be used together.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Sets the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given  <u>record</u>  in
              <u>table</u> to <u>value</u>.  For map columns, a <u>key</u> may optionally be speci‐
              fied, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in that column
              is  changed  (or  added,  if none exists), instead of the entire
              map.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> [<u>key</u><b>=</b>]<u>value</u>...
              Adds the specified value or key-value pair to <u>column</u>  in  <u>record</u>
              in  <u>table</u>.   If <u>column</u> is a map, then <u>key</u> is required, otherwise
              it is prohibited.  If <u>key</u> already exists in a map  column,  then
              the  current  <u>value</u>  is not replaced (use the <b>set</b> command to re‐
              place an existing value).

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>value</u>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from  <u>column</u>  in
              <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>.  The first form applies to columns that are not
              maps: each specified <u>value</u> is removed from the column.  The sec‐
              ond and third forms apply to map columns: if only a <u>key</u> is spec‐
              ified,  then  any  key-value pair with the given <u>key</u> is removed,
              regardless of its value; if a <u>value</u> is given then a pair is  re‐
              moved only if both key and value match.

              It  is not an error if the column does not contain the specified
              key or value or pair.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>...
              Sets each <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u> to the empty  set  or  empty
              map,  as appropriate.  This command applies only to columns that
              are allowed to be empty.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--id=(@</b><u>name</u> | <u>uuid</u>] <b>create</b> <u>table</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Creates a new record in <u>table</u> and sets  the  initial  values  of
              each  <u>column</u>.  Columns not explicitly set will receive their de‐
              fault values.  Outputs the UUID of the new row.

              If <b>@</b><u>name</u> is specified, then the UUID for the new row may be  re‐
              ferred to by that name elsewhere in the same <b>vtep-ctl</b> invocation
              in  contexts where a UUID is expected.  Such references may pre‐
              cede or follow the <b>create</b> command.

              If a valid <u>uuid</u> is specified, then it is used as the UUID of the
              new row.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only
                     when they can be reached directly or indirectly from  the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table.   Except  for  records in the <b>QoS</b> or
                     <b>Queue</b> tables, records that are  not  reachable  from  the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table  are  automatically  deleted from the
                     database.  This  deletion  happens  immediately,  without
                     waiting  for additional <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands or other data‐
                     base activity.  Thus, a <b>create</b> command must generally  be
                     accompanied   by  additional  commands  <u>within</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>same</u>
                     <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <u>invocation</u> to add a chain of references to  the
                     newly  created  record  from  the  top-level <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                     record.  The <b>EXAMPLES</b> section gives  some  examples  that
                     show how to do this.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u>...
              Deletes each specified <u>record</u> from <u>table</u>.  Unless <b>--if-exists</b> is
              specified, each <u>record</u>s must exist.

       <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u>
              Deletes all records from the <u>table</u>.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     The <b>destroy</b> command is only useful for records in the <b>QoS</b>
                     or  <b>Queue</b>  tables.  Records in other tables are automati‐
                     cally deleted from the database when they become unreach‐
                     able from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table.  This means that delet‐
                     ing the last reference to  a  record  is  sufficient  for
                     deleting the record itself.  For records in these tables,
                     <b>destroy</b>  is  silently  ignored.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section
                     below for more information.

       <b>wait-until</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
              Waits until <u>table</u> contains a record named  <u>record</u>  whose  <u>column</u>
              equals  <u>value</u>  or,  if <u>key</u> is specified, whose <u>column</u> contains a
              <u>key</u> with the specified <u>value</u>.  This command  supports  the  same
              operators and semantics described for the <b>find</b> command above.

              If no <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u> arguments are given, this command waits
              only  until  <u>record</u>  exists.   If more than one such argument is
              given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Usually <b>wait-until</b> should be placed at the beginning of a
                     set  of  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  commands.   For  example,  <b>wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> waits until a
                     bridge named <b>br0</b> is created, then prints its  <b>datapath_id</b>
                     column,  whereas <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> <b>--</b> <b>wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> will abort if no bridge named <b>br0</b> exists  when
                     <b>ovs-vsctl</b> initially connects to the database.

              Consider specifying <b>--timeout=0</b> along with <b>--wait-until</b>, to pre‐
              vent <b>vtep-ctl</b> from terminating after waiting only at most 5 sec‐
              onds.

       <b>comment</b> [<u>arg</u>]...
              This  command  has  no  effect on behavior, but any database log
              record created by the command will include the command  and  its
              arguments.

<b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax, or configuration file error.

       2      The  <u>switch</u> argument to <b>ps-exists</b> specified the name of a physi‐
              cal switch that does not exist.
