NAME
       ovsdb-server - _Server database schema

       Every  ovsdb-server  (version 2.9 or later) always hosts an instance of
       this schema, which holds information on the status and configuration of
       the server itself. This database is read-only. This  manpage  describes
       the schema for this database.

TABLE SUMMARY
       The  following list summarizes the purpose of each of the tables in the
       _Server database.  Each table is described in more detail  on  a  later
       page.

       Table     Purpose
       Database  Databases.

Database TABLE
       This  table describes the databases hosted by the database server, with
       one row per database. As its database configuration and status changes,
       the server automatically and immediately updates the table to match.

       The OVSDB protocol specified in RFC 7047 does not provide a way for  an
       OVSDB  client  to  find  out about some kinds of configuration changes,
       such as about databases added or removed while a client is connected to
       the server, or databases changing between read/write and read-only  due
       to  a transition between active and backup roles. This table provides a
       solution: clients can monitor the table’s contents to  find  out  about
       important changes.

       Traditionally,  ovsdb-server disconnects all of its clients when a sig‐
       nificant configuration change occurs, because this prompts a well-writ‐
       ten client to reassess what is available from the server when it recon‐
       nects. Because this table provides an alternative  and  more  efficient
       way  to  find  out  about  those  changes,  OVS 2.9 also introduces the
       set_db_change_aware  RPC,  documented  in  ovsdb-server(7),  to   allow
       clients to suppress this disconnection behavior.

       When a database is removed from the server, in addition to Database ta‐
       ble  updates,  the  server sends canceled messages, as described in RFC
       7047 section 4.1.4, in reply to outstanding transactions  for  the  re‐
       moved database. The server also cancels any outstanding monitoring ini‐
       tiated  by  monitor  or monitor_cond requested on the removed database,
       sending the monitor_canceled RPC  described  in  ovsdb-server(7).  Only
       clients  that  disable  disconnection  with set_db_change_aware receive
       these messages.

       Clients can use the _uuid column in this table as a generation  number.
       The  server  generates  a fresh _uuid every time it adds a database, so
       that removing and then re-adding a database to the  server  causes  its
       row _uuid to change.

   Summary:
       name                          string
       model                         string,   one  of  clustered,  relay,  or
                                     standalone
       schema                        optional string
       connected                     boolean
       Clustered Databases:
         leader                      boolean
         cid                         optional uuid
         sid                         optional uuid
         index                       optional integer

   Details:
       name: string
              The database’s name, as specified in its schema.

       model: string, one of clustered, relay, or standalone
              The storage model: standalone for a standalone or  active-backup
              database,  clustered for a clustered database, relay for a relay
              database.

       schema: optional string
              The database schema, as a JSON string. In the case  of  a  clus‐
              tered  database,  this  is  empty  until it finishes joining its
              cluster. In the case of a relay database, this is empty until it
              connects to the relay source.

       connected: boolean
              True if the database is connected to its storage.  A  standalone
              database  is always connected. A clustered database is connected
              if the server is in contact with a majority of  its  cluster.  A
              relay database is connected if the server is in contact with the
              relay  source, i.e. is connected to the server it syncs from. An
              unconnected database cannot be modified and its  data  might  be
              unavailable or stale.

     Clustered Databases:

       These  columns are most interesting and in some cases only relevant for
       clustered databases, that is, those where the  model  column  is  clus‐
       tered.

       leader: boolean
              True  if the database is the leader in its cluster. For a stand‐
              alone or active-backup database, this is always true. For a  re‐
              lay database, this is always false.

       cid: optional uuid
              The  cluster  ID for this database, which is the same for all of
              the servers that host this particular clustered database. For  a
              standalone, active-backup or relay database, this is empty.

       sid: optional uuid
              The  server ID for this database, different for each server that
              hosts a particular clustered database. A server that hosts  more
              than  one  clustered  database will have a different sid in each
              one. For a standalone, active-backup or relay database, this  is
              empty.

       index: optional integer
              For  a  clustered database, the index of the log entry currently
              exposed to clients. For a given server, this increases monotoni‐
              cally. When a client switches from one server to  another  in  a
              cluster,  it  can ensure that it never sees an older snapshot of
              data by avoiding servers that have index less than  the  largest
              value they have already observed.

              For  a  standalone,  active-backup  or  relay  database, this is
              empty.
