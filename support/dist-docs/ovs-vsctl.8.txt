NAME
       ovs-vsctl - utility for querying and configuring ovs-vswitchd

SYNOPSIS
       ovs-vsctl  [options]  -- [options] command [args] [-- [options] command
       [args]]...

DESCRIPTION
       The  ovs-vsctl  program  configures  ovs-vswitchd(8)  by  providing   a
       high-level    interface    to    its   configuration   database.    See
       ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database
       schema.

       ovs-vsctl  connects  to  an ovsdb-server process that maintains an Open
       vSwitch configuration database.  Using this connection, it queries  and
       possibly  applies  changes  to  the database, depending on the supplied
       commands.  Then, if it applied any changes, by default it  waits  until
       ovs-vswitchd  has  finished  reconfiguring itself before it exits.  (If
       you use ovs-vsctl when ovs-vswitchd is not running, use --no-wait.)

       ovs-vsctl can perform any number of commands in a  single  run,  imple‐
       mented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The  ovs-vsctl  command  line  begins  with global options (see OPTIONS
       below for details).  The global options are followed  by  one  or  more
       commands.   Each  command  should begin with -- by itself as a command-
       line argument, to separate it from the  following  commands.   (The  --
       before  the first command is optional.)  The command itself starts with
       command-specific options, if any, followed by the command name and  any
       arguments.  See EXAMPLES below for syntax examples.

   Linux VLAN Bridging Compatibility
       The  ovs-vsctl  program  supports  the model of a bridge implemented by
       Open vSwitch, in which a  single  bridge  supports  ports  on  multiple
       VLANs.   In  this  model,  each port on a bridge is either a trunk port
       that potentially passes packets tagged with 802.1Q headers that  desig‐
       nate  VLANs  or  it  is  assigned  a single implicit VLAN that is never
       tagged with an 802.1Q header.

       For  compatibility  with  software  designed  for  the  Linux   bridge,
       ovs-vsctl  also  supports  a  model  in which traffic associated with a
       given 802.1Q VLAN is segregated into a separate bridge.  A special form
       of  the  add-br command (see below) creates a ``fake bridge'' within an
       Open vSwitch bridge to simulate this  behavior.   When  such  a  ``fake
       bridge'' is active, ovs-vsctl will treat it much like a bridge separate
       from its ``parent bridge,''  but  the  actual  implementation  in  Open
       vSwitch  uses  only  a  single  bridge,  with  ports on the fake bridge
       assigned the implicit VLAN of the fake bridge of which  they  are  mem‐
       bers.   (A  fake bridge for VLAN 0 receives packets that have no 802.1Q
       tag or a tag with VLAN 0.)

OPTIONS
       The following options affect the behavior ovs-vsctl as a  whole.   Some
       individual commands also accept their own options, which are given just
       before the command name.  If the first command on the command line  has
       options,  then  those options must be separated from the global options
       by --.

       --db=server
              Sets server as the database server that  ovs-vsctl  contacts  to
              query    or    modify    configuration.     The    default    is
              unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock.  server must take one of  the
              following forms:

              ssl:ip:port
                     The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must be expressed as an IP address (not a  DNS  name)  in
                     IPv4  or  IPv6 address format.  If ip is an IPv6 address,
                     then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:  ssl:[::1]:6632.
                     The  --private-key,  --certificate, and --ca-cert options
                     are mandatory when this form is used.

              tcp:ip:port
                     Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4
                     or  IPv6  address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip
                     with square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6632.

              unix:file
                     On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket  named
                     file.

                     On  Windows,  connect to a localhost TCP port whose value
                     is written in file.

              pssl:port[:ip]
                     Listen on the  given  SSL  port  for  a  connection.   By
                     default,  connections are not bound to a particular local
                     IP address and it listens only on  IPv4  (but  not  IPv6)
                     addresses,  but specifying ip limits connections to those
                     from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If ip is
                     an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
                     pssl:6632:[::1].  The --private-key,  --certificate,  and
                     --ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.

              ptcp:port[:ip]
                     Listen  on  the  given  TCP  port  for  a connection.  By
                     default, connections are not bound to a particular  local
                     IP  address  and  it  listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6)
                     addresses, but ip may be specified  to  listen  only  for
                     connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.
                     If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack‐
                     ets, e.g.: ptcp:6632:[::1].

              punix:file
                     On  POSIX,  listen on the Unix domain server socket named
                     file for a connection.

                     On Windows, listen on a kernel chosen  TCP  port  on  the
                     localhost. The kernel chosen TCP port value is written in
                     file.

       --no-wait
              Prevents ovs-vsctl from waiting for ovs-vswitchd to  reconfigure
              itself  according  to  the  the  modified database.  This option
              should be  used  if  ovs-vswitchd  is  not  running;  otherwise,
              ovs-vsctl will not exit until ovs-vswitchd starts.

              This  option  has  no  effect  if  the commands specified do not
              change the database.

       --no-syslog
              By default, ovs-vsctl logs its arguments and the details of  any
              changes  that  it makes to the system log.  This option disables
              this logging.

              This option is equivalent to --verbose=vsctl:syslog:warn.

       --oneline
              Modifies the output format so that the output for  each  command
              is  printed  on  a  single line.  New-line characters that would
              otherwise separate lines are printed as \n, and any instances of
              \ that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.  Prints
              a blank line for each command that has no output.   This  option
              does  not  affect the formatting of output from the list or find
              commands; see Table Formatting Options below.

       --dry-run
              Prevents ovs-vsctl from actually modifying the database.

       -t secs
       --timeout=secs
              By default, or with a secs of 0, ovs-vsctl waits forever  for  a
              response  from  the  database.   This  option  limits runtime to
              approximately secs seconds.  If the timeout  expires,  ovs-vsctl
              will exit with a SIGALRM signal.  (A timeout would normally hap‐
              pen only if the database cannot be contacted, or if  the  system
              is overloaded.)

       --retry
              Without  this option, if ovs-vsctl connects outward to the data‐
              base server (the default) then ovs-vsctl  will  try  to  connect
              once  and exit with an error if the connection fails (which usu‐
              ally means that ovsdb-server is not running).

              With this option, or if --db  specifies  that  ovs-vsctl  should
              listen for an incoming connection from the database server, then
              ovs-vsctl will wait for a connection to the database forever.

              Regardless of this setting, --timeout  always  limits  how  long
              ovs-vsctl will wait.

   Table Formatting Options
       These  options control the format of output from the list and find com‐
       mands.

       -f format
       --format=format
              Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of  for‐
              mat are available:

              table  2-D text tables with aligned columns.

              list (default)
                     A  list  with one column per line and rows separated by a
                     blank line.

              html   HTML tables.

              csv    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

              json   JSON format as defined in RFC  4627.   The  output  is  a
                     sequence  of  JSON  objects, each of which corresponds to
                     one table.  Each JSON object has  the  following  members
                     with the noted values:

                     caption
                            The  table's  caption.   This member is omitted if
                            the table has no caption.

                     headings
                            An array with one element per table column.   Each
                            array element is a string giving the corresponding
                            column's heading.

                     data   An array with one element  per  table  row.   Each
                            element  is also an array with one element per ta‐
                            ble column.  The  elements  of  this  second-level
                            array  are  the  cells  that constitute the table.
                            Cells that represent OVSDB data or data types  are
                            expressed  in  the  format  described in the OVSDB
                            specification; other cells are simply expressed as
                            text strings.

       -d format
       --data=format
              Sets the formatting for cells within output tables.  The follow‐
              ing types of format are available:

              string (default)
                     The simple format described in the Database  Values  sec‐
                     tion below.

              bare   The  simple  format with punctuation stripped off: [] and
                     {} are omitted around  sets,  maps,  and  empty  columns,
                     items  within  sets  and  maps  are  space-separated, and
                     strings are never quoted.  This format may be easier  for
                     scripts to parse.

              json   JSON.

              The  json  output  format  always  outputs cells in JSON format,
              ignoring this option.

       --no-heading
              This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in
              the first row of table output.

       --pretty
              By  default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as possible.
              This option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more  read‐
              able  fashion.   Members  of  objects and elements of arrays are
              printed one per line, with indentation.

              This option does not affect JSON  in  tables,  which  is  always
              printed compactly.

       --bare Equivalent to --format=list --data=bare --no-headings.

   Public Key Infrastructure Options
       -p privkey.pem
       --private-key=privkey.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              ovs-vsctl's identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       -c cert.pem
       --certificate=cert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on -p or --private-key to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       -C cacert.pem
       --ca-cert=cacert.pem
              Specifies   a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate  that
              ovs-vsctl should use to verify certificates presented to  it  by
              SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers use
              to verify the certificate specified on -c or  --certificate,  or
              it may be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)

       -C none
       --ca-cert=none
              Disables  verification  of  certificates presented by SSL peers.
              This introduces a security risk, because it means that  certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       --bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
              When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as -C or
              --ca-cert.  If it does not exist, then ovs-vsctl will attempt to
              obtain  the  CA  certificate  from the SSL peer on its first SSL
              connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is success‐
              ful,  it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and
              from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a cer‐
              tificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              This  option  exposes  the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle
              attack obtaining the initial CA certificate, but it may be  use‐
              ful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certifi‐
              cate as part of the SSL certificate  chain.   The  SSL  protocol
              does not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.

       --peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM file that contains one or more additional cer‐
              tificates to send to SSL peers.  peer-cacert.pem should  be  the
              CA  certificate  used  to sign ovs-vsctl's own certificate, that
              is, the  certificate  specified  on  -c  or  --certificate.   If
              ovs-vsctl's  certificate  is self-signed, then --certificate and
              --peer-ca-cert should specify the same file.

              This option is not useful in normal operation, because  the  SSL
              peer  must  already have the CA certificate for the peer to have
              any confidence in ovs-vsctl's identity.  However, this offers  a
              way  for  a  new installation to bootstrap the CA certificate on
              its first SSL connection.

       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any spec, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and facility to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list of
              words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up  to  one  from
              each category below:

              ·      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the vlog/list com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              ·      syslog,  console,  or file, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.

                     On  Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  --syslog-target  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              ·      off,  emer,  err,  warn, info, or dbg, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  off filters out all  messages.   See  ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for file, logging to a file
              will not take place unless --log-file  is  also  specified  (see
              below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  --ver‐
              bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:facility:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:facility:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  facility  to  pattern.   Refer  to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       --log-file[=file]
              Enables logging to a file.  If file is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name   used   if   file    is    omitted    is    /var/log/open‐
              vswitch/ovs-vsctl.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP port on host, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The host must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

COMMANDS
       The  commands  implemented  by  ovs-vsctl are described in the sections
       below.

   Open vSwitch Commands
       These commands work with an Open vSwitch as a whole.

       init   Initializes the Open vSwitch database, if it is empty.   If  the
              database  has  already  been  initialized,  this  command has no
              effect.

              Any successful ovs-vsctl command automatically  initializes  the
              Open  vSwitch database if it is empty.  This command is provided
              to initialize the database without executing any other command.

       show   Prints a brief overview of the database contents.

       emer-reset
              Reset the configuration into a  clean  state.   It  deconfigures
              OpenFlow  controllers,  OVSDB servers, and SSL, and deletes port
              mirroring, fail_mode, NetFlow, sFlow, and  IPFIX  configuration.
              This  command  also removes all other-config keys from all data‐
              base records, except that other-config:hwaddr is preserved if it
              is  present  in a Bridge record.  Other networking configuration
              is left as-is.

   Bridge Commands
       These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch bridges.

       [--may-exist] add-br bridge
              Creates a new bridge named bridge.  Initially  the  bridge  will
              have no ports (other than bridge itself).

              Without  --may-exist,  attempting to create a bridge that exists
              is an error.  With --may-exist, this  command  does  nothing  if
              bridge already exists as a real bridge.

       [--may-exist] add-br bridge parent vlan
              Creates  a ``fake bridge'' named bridge within the existing Open
              vSwitch bridge parent, which must already  exist  and  must  not
              itself  be a fake bridge.  The new fake bridge will be on 802.1Q
              VLAN vlan, which must be an integer between  0  and  4095.   The
              parent  bridge  must  not  already  have a fake bridge for vlan.
              Initially bridge will have no ports (other than bridge itself).

              Without --may-exist, attempting to create a bridge  that  exists
              is  an  error.   With  --may-exist, this command does nothing if
              bridge already exists as a VLAN bridge under parent for vlan.

       [--if-exists] del-br bridge
              Deletes bridge and all of  its  ports.   If  bridge  is  a  real
              bridge,  this  command  also  deletes any fake bridges that were
              created with bridge as parent, including all of their ports.

              Without --if-exists, attempting to delete a bridge that does not
              exist  is  an  error.   With --if-exists, attempting to delete a
              bridge that does not exist has no effect.

       [--real|--fake] list-br
              Lists all existing real and fake bridges on standard output, one
              per  line.  With --real or --fake, only bridges of that type are
              returned.

       br-exists bridge
              Tests whether bridge exists as a real or fake  bridge.   If  so,
              ovs-vsctl   exits  successfully  with  exit  code  0.   If  not,
              ovs-vsctl exits unsuccessfully with exit code 2.

       br-to-vlan bridge
              If bridge is a fake bridge, prints the bridge's 802.1Q VLAN as a
              decimal integer.  If bridge is a real bridge, prints 0.

       br-to-parent bridge
              If  bridge  is  a  fake  bridge,  prints  the name of its parent
              bridge.  If bridge is a real bridge, print bridge.

       br-set-external-id bridge key [value]
              Sets or clears an ``external ID'' value on bridge.  These values
              are  intended to identify entities external to Open vSwitch with
              which bridge is associated, e.g. the bridge's  identifier  in  a
              virtualization  management  platform.  The Open vSwitch database
              schema specifies well-known key values, but key  and  value  are
              otherwise arbitrary strings.

              If  value  is  specified,  then  key is set to value for bridge,
              overwriting any previous value.  If value is omitted,  then  key
              is  removed  from  bridge's  set  of  external  IDs  (if  it was
              present).

              For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to  that
              of  a  set  or  remove command in the external-ids column of the
              Bridge table.  For fake bridges, it actually modifies keys  with
              names prefixed by fake-bridge- in the Port table.

       br-get-external-id bridge [key]
              Queries  the  external  IDs on bridge.  If key is specified, the
              output is the value for that key or the empty string if  key  is
              unset.   If  key  is  omitted,  the output is key=value, one per
              line, for each key-value pair.

              For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to  that
              of a get command in the external-ids column of the Bridge table.
              For fake  bridges,  it  queries  keys  with  names  prefixed  by
              fake-bridge- in the Port table.

   Port Commands
       These  commands  examine and manipulate Open vSwitch ports.  These com‐
       mands treat a bonded port as a single entity.

       list-ports bridge
              Lists all of the ports within bridge on standard output, one per
              line.  The local port bridge is not included in the list.

       [--may-exist] add-port bridge port [column[:key]=value]...
              Creates  on bridge a new port named port from the network device
              of the same name.

              Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record  cre‐
              ated  by the command.  For example, tag=9 would make the port an
              access port for VLAN 9.  The syntax is the same as that for  the
              set command (see Database Commands below).

              Without  --may-exist, attempting to create a port that exists is
              an error.  With --may-exist, this command does nothing  if  port
              already exists on bridge and is not a bonded port.

       [--fake-iface] add-bond bridge port iface... [column[:key]=value]...
              Creates  on bridge a new port named port that bonds together the
              network devices given as each iface.  At  least  two  interfaces
              must be named.

              Optional  arguments set values of column in the Port record cre‐
              ated by the command.  The syntax is the same as that for the set
              command (see Database Commands below).

              With  --fake-iface,  a fake interface with the name port is cre‐
              ated.  This should only be used for  compatibility  with  legacy
              software that requires it.

              Without  --may-exist, attempting to create a port that exists is
              an error.  With --may-exist, this command does nothing  if  port
              already  exists  on bridge and bonds together exactly the speci‐
              fied interfaces.

       [--if-exists] del-port [bridge] port
              Deletes port.  If bridge is omitted, port is removed from  what‐
              ever  bridge contains it; if bridge is specified, it must be the
              real or fake bridge that contains port.

              Without --if-exists, attempting to delete a port that  does  not
              exist  is  an  error.   With --if-exists, attempting to delete a
              port that does not exist has no effect.

       [--if-exists] --with-iface del-port [bridge] iface
              Deletes the port named iface or  that  has  an  interface  named
              iface.   If bridge is omitted, the port is removed from whatever
              bridge contains it; if bridge is specified, it must be the  real
              or fake bridge that contains the port.

              Without --if-exists, attempting to delete the port for an inter‐
              face that  does  not  exist  is  an  error.   With  --if-exists,
              attempting  to  delete  the  port for an interface that does not
              exist has no effect.

       port-to-br port
              Prints the name of the bridge that  contains  port  on  standard
              output.

   Interface Commands
       These  commands  examine  the  interfaces  attached  to an Open vSwitch
       bridge.  These commands treat a bonded port as a collection of  two  or
       more interfaces, rather than as a single port.

       list-ifaces bridge
              Lists  all  of  the interfaces within bridge on standard output,
              one per line.  The local port bridge  is  not  included  in  the
              list.

       iface-to-br iface
              Prints  the  name  of the bridge that contains iface on standard
              output.

   OpenFlow Controller Connectivity
       ovs-vswitchd can perform all configured bridging and switching locally,
       or  it can be configured to communicate with one or more external Open‐
       Flow controllers.  The switch is typically configured to connect  to  a
       primary  controller  that  takes  charge  of the bridge's flow table to
       implement a network policy.  In addition, the switch can be  configured
       to listen to connections from service controllers.  Service controllers
       are typically used for occasional support and  maintenance,  e.g.  with
       ovs-ofctl.

       get-controller bridge
              Prints the configured controller target.

       del-controller bridge
              Deletes the configured controller target.

       set-controller bridge target...
              Sets  the  configured controller target or targets.  Each target
              may use any of the following forms:

              ssl:ip[:port]
              tcp:ip[:port]
                     The specified port on the host at  the  given  ip,  which
                     must  be  expressed  as an IP address (not a DNS name) in
                     IPv4 or IPv6 address  format.   Wrap  IPv6  addresses  in
                     square  brackets,  e.g.  tcp:[::1]:6633.   For  ssl,  the
                     --private-key, --certificate, and --ca-cert  options  are
                     mandatory.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6633.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6653, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

              unix:file
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named file.

                     On Windows, a localhost TCP port written in file.

              pssl:[port][:ip]
              ptcp:[port][:ip]
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections on port.  The default
                     port is 6633, but a future version of Open  vSwitch  will
                     change  the  default  to  the IANA-defined port 6653.  By
                     default, connections are allowed from any  IPv4  address.
                     Specify ip as an IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6 address
                     (e.g. ptcp:6633:[::1]).  DNS names may not be used.   For
                     pssl,   the  --private-key,--certificate,  and  --ca-cert
                     options are mandatory.

              punix:file
                     Listens for  OpenFlow  connections  on  the  Unix  domain
                     server socket named file.

     Controller Failure Settings

       When  a  controller  is  configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible for
       setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if  the  connection  to  the
       controller  fails,  no  new  network connections can be set up.  If the
       connection to the controller stays down long  enough,  no  packets  can
       pass through the switch at all.

       If  the  value  is  standalone, or if neither of these settings is set,
       ovs-vswitchd will take over responsibility for setting up flows when no
       message has been received from the controller for three times the inac‐
       tivity probe interval.  In this mode, ovs-vswitchd causes the  datapath
       to  act  like  an ordinary MAC-learning switch.  ovs-vswitchd will con‐
       tinue to retry connecting to the controller in the background and, when
       the connection succeeds, it discontinues its standalone behavior.

       If  this option is set to secure, ovs-vswitchd will not set up flows on
       its own when the controller connection fails.

       get-fail-mode bridge
              Prints the configured failure mode.

       del-fail-mode bridge
              Deletes the configured failure mode.

       set-fail-mode bridge standalone|secure
              Sets the configured failure mode.

   Manager Connectivity
       These  commands  manipulate   the   manager_options   column   in   the
       Open_vSwitch  table  and rows in the Managers table.  When ovsdb-server
       is configured to use the manager_options column for  OVSDB  connections
       (as described in INSTALL.Linux and in the startup scripts provided with
       Open vSwitch), this allows the administrator to use ovs-vsctl  to  con‐
       figure database connections.

       get-manager
              Prints the configured manager(s).

       del-manager
              Deletes the configured manager(s).

       set-manager target...
              Sets  the configured manager target or targets.  Each target may
              use any of the following forms:

              ssl:ip:port
                     The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must  be  expressed  as an IP address (not a DNS name) in
                     IPv4 or IPv6 address format.  If ip is an  IPv6  address,
                     then  wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.: ssl:[::1]:6632.
                     The --private-key, --certificate, and  --ca-cert  options
                     are mandatory when this form is used.

              tcp:ip:port
                     Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4
                     or IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then  wrap  ip
                     with square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6632.

              unix:file
                     On  POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
                     file.

                     On Windows, connect to a localhost TCP port  whose  value
                     is written in file.

              pssl:port[:ip]
                     Listen  on  the  given  SSL  port  for  a connection.  By
                     default, connections are not bound to a particular  local
                     IP  address  and  it  listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6)
                     addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to  those
                     from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If ip is
                     an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
                     pssl:6632:[::1].   The  --private-key, --certificate, and
                     --ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.

              ptcp:port[:ip]
                     Listen on the  given  TCP  port  for  a  connection.   By
                     default,  connections are not bound to a particular local
                     IP address and it listens only on  IPv4  (but  not  IPv6)
                     addresses,  but  ip  may  be specified to listen only for
                     connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.
                     If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack‐
                     ets, e.g.: ptcp:6632:[::1].

              punix:file
                     On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server  socket  named
                     file for a connection.

                     On  Windows,  listen  on  a kernel chosen TCP port on the
                     localhost. The kernel chosen TCP port value is written in
                     file.

   SSL Configuration
       When  ovs-vswitchd  is configured to connect over SSL for management or
       controller connectivity, the following parameters are required:

       private-key
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as the vir‐
              tual switch's identity for SSL connections to the controller.

       certificate
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing a certificate, signed by the
              certificate authority (CA) used by the controller  and  manager,
              that  certifies  the virtual switch's private key, identifying a
              trustworthy switch.

       ca-cert
              Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to  ver‐
              ify  that  the virtual switch is connected to a trustworthy con‐
              troller.

       These files are read only once, at ovs-vswitchd startup time.  If their
       contents change, ovs-vswitchd must be killed and restarted.

       These  SSL  settings  apply  to all SSL connections made by the virtual
       switch.

       get-ssl
              Prints the SSL configuration.

       del-ssl
              Deletes the current SSL configuration.

       [--bootstrap] set-ssl private-key certificate ca-cert
              Sets the SSL configuration.  The --bootstrap option is described
              below.

     CA Certificate Bootstrap

       Ordinarily,  all of the files named in the SSL configuration must exist
       when ovs-vswitchd starts.  However, if the ca-cert file does not  exist
       and  the --bootstrap option is given, then ovs-vswitchd will attempt to
       obtain the CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL  connec‐
       tion  and  save it to the named PEM file.  If it is successful, it will
       immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL
       connections  must  be  authenticated  by a certificate signed by the CA
       certificate thus obtained.

       This option exposes the SSL connection to  a  man-in-the-middle  attack
       obtaining  the  initial  CA certificate, but it may be useful for boot‐
       strapping.

       This option is only useful if the controller sends its  CA  certificate
       as  part  of  the  SSL  certificate  chain.   The SSL protocol does not
       require the controller to send the CA certificate.

   Database Commands
       These commands query and modify the contents of ovsdb tables.  They are
       a slight abstraction of the ovsdb interface and as such they operate at
       a lower level than other ovs-vsctl commands.

     Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns

       Each of these commands has a table parameter to identify a table within
       the  database.   Many of them also take a record parameter that identi‐
       fies a particular record within a table.  The record parameter  may  be
       the  UUID  for a record, and many tables offer additional ways to iden‐
       tify records.  Some commands also take column parameters that  identify
       a particular field within the records in a table.

       The following tables are currently defined:

       Open_vSwitch
              Global  configuration  for an ovs-vswitchd.  This table contains
              exactly one record, identified by specifying  .  as  the  record
              name.

       Bridge Configuration  for a bridge within an Open vSwitch.  Records may
              be identified by bridge name.

       Port   A bridge port.  Records may be identified by port name.

       Interface
              A network device attached to a port.  Records may be  identified
              by name.

       Flow_Table
              Configuration for a particular OpenFlow flow table.  Records may
              be identified by name.

       QoS    Quality-of-service configuration for a  Port.   Records  may  be
              identified by port name.

       Queue  Configuration for one queue within a QoS configuration.  Records

              may be identified by mirror name.

       Controller
              Configuration for an OpenFlow controller.  A controller attached
              to a particular bridge may be identified by the bridge's name.

       Manager
              Configuration for an OVSDB connection.  Records may  be  identi‐
              fied by target (e.g. tcp:1.2.3.4).

       NetFlow
              A  NetFlow  configuration  attached to a bridge.  Records may be
              identified by bridge name.

       SSL    The global  SSL  configuration  for  ovs-vswitchd.   The  record
              attached to the Open_vSwitch table may be identified by specify‐
              ing . as the record name.

       sFlow  An sFlow exporter configuration attached to a  bridge.   Records
              may be identified by bridge name.

       IPFIX  An  IPFIX  exporter configuration attached to a bridge.  Records
              may be identified by bridge name.

              An IPFIX exporter configuration attached to a  bridge  for  sam‐
              pling packets on a per-flow basis using OpenFlow sample actions.

       Record names must be specified in full and with correct capitalization.
       Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and --  and  _  are
       treated interchangeably.  Unique abbreviations are acceptable, e.g. net
       or n is sufficient to identify the NetFlow table.

     Database Values

       Each column in the database accepts a fixed type  of  data.   The  cur‐
       rently defined basic types, and their representations, are:

       integer
              A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1, inclusive.

       real   A floating-point number.

       Boolean
              True or false, written true or false, respectively.

       string An  arbitrary  Unicode  string,  except  that null bytes are not
              allowed.  Quotes are optional for most strings that  begin  with
              an  English  letter  or  underscore and consist only of letters,
              underscores, hyphens, and periods.  However, true and false  and
              strings  that  match  the  syntax  of  UUIDs (see below) must be
              enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from  other  basic
              types.   When  double  quotes  are  used,  the syntax is that of
              strings in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to escape  special
              characters.   The  empty string must be represented as a pair of
              double quotes ("").

       UUID   Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122,
              e.g.  f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6,  or an @name defined
              by a get or create command within the same ovs-vsctl invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a sin‐
       gle  comma.   When  multiple  values  are  present,  duplicates are not
       allowed, and order is not important.  Conversely, some database columns
       can have an empty set of values, represented as [], and square brackets
       may optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single values as well.

       A few database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where  the  key
       and  the  value are each some fixed database type.  These are specified
       in the form key=value, where key and value follow the  syntax  for  the
       column's  key  type  and value type, respectively.  When multiple pairs
       are present (separated by spaces or a comma), duplicate  keys  are  not
       allowed,  and  again  the order is not important.  Duplicate values are
       allowed.  An empty map is represented as {}.  Curly braces may  option‐
       ally  enclose  non-empty  maps  as  well (but use quotes to prevent the
       shell  from  expanding  other-config={0=x,1=y}  into   other-config=0=x
       other-config=1=y, which may not have the desired effect).

     Database Command Syntax

       [--if-exists] [--columns=column[,column]...] list table [record]...
              Lists  the  data  in  each  specified record.  If no records are
              specified, lists all the records in table.

              If --columns  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns  are
              listed,  in  the  specified  order.   Otherwise, all columns are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              Without --if-exists, it is an error if any specified record does
              not  exist.   With  --if-exists,  the command ignores any record
              that does not exist, without producing any output.

       [--columns=column[,column]...] find table [column[:key]=value]...
              Lists the data in each record in table whose column equals value
              or,  if  key  is specified, whose column contains a key with the
              specified value.  The following operators may be used where = is
              written in the syntax summary:

              = != < > <= >=
                     Selects  records  in  which column[:key] equals, does not
                     equal, is less than, is greater than,  is  less  than  or
                     equal  to,  or is greater than or equal to value, respec‐
                     tively.

                     Consider column[:key] and  value  as  sets  of  elements.
                     Identical  sets  are considered equal.  Otherwise, if the
                     sets have different numbers of  elements,  then  the  set
                     with  more  elements  is considered to be larger.  Other‐
                     wise, consider a  element  from  each  set  pairwise,  in
                     increasing  order  within  each set.  The first pair that
                     differs determines the result.  (For a column  that  con‐
                     tains  key-value  pairs, first all the keys are compared,
                     and values are considered only if the  two  sets  contain
                     identical keys.)

              {=} {!=}
                     Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

              {<=}   Selects  records  in  which  column[:key]  is a subset of
                     value.  For example, flood-vlans{<=}1,2  selects  records
                     in  which the flood-vlans column is the empty set or con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 or both.

              {<}    Selects records in which column[:key] is a proper  subset
                     of value.  For example, flood-vlans{<}1,2 selects records
                     in which the flood-vlans column is the empty set or  con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 but not both.

              {>=} {>}
                     Same as {<=} and {<}, respectively, except that the rela‐
                     tionship is reversed.   For  example,  flood-vlans{>=}1,2
                     selects  records in which the flood-vlans column contains
                     both 1 and 2.

              For arithmetic operators (= != < > <= >=), when key is specified
              but  a  particular  record's  column  does  not contain key, the
              record is always omitted from the results.  Thus, the  condition
              other-config:mtu!=1500 matches records that have a mtu key whose
              value is not 1500, but not those that lack an mtu key.

              For the set operators, when key is specified  but  a  particular
              record's  column  does  not  contain key, the comparison is done
              against  an  empty  set.    Thus,   the   condition   other-con‐
              fig:mtu{!=}1500  matches records that have a mtu key whose value
              is not 1500 and those that lack an mtu key.

              Don't forget to escape < or > from interpretation by the shell.

              If --columns  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns  are
              listed,  in  the  specified  order.   Otherwise  all columns are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same  ovs-vsctl  invoca‐
              tion will be wrong.

       [--if-exists] [--id=@name] get table record [column[:key]]...
              Prints the value of each specified column in the given record in
              table.  For map columns, a key may optionally be  specified,  in
              which  case  the  value  associated  with  key  in the column is
              printed, instead of the entire map.

              Without --if-exists, it is an error if record does not exist  or
              key  is  specified,  if  key  does  not  exist  in record.  With
              --if-exists, a missing record yields no output and a missing key
              prints a blank line.

              If  @name is specified, then the UUID for record may be referred
              to by that name later in the same ovs-vsctl invocation  in  con‐
              texts where a UUID is expected.

              Both  --id and the column arguments are optional, but usually at
              least one or the other should be specified.  If both  are  omit‐
              ted,  then get has no effect except to verify that record exists
              in table.

              --id and --if-exists cannot be used together.

       [--if-exists] set table record column[:key]=value...
              Sets the value of each specified column in the given  record  in
              table to value.  For map columns, a key may optionally be speci‐
              fied, in which case the value associated with key in that column
              is  changed  (or  added,  if none exists), instead of the entire
              map.

              Without --if-exists, it is an error if record  does  not  exist.
              With  --if-exists,  this command does nothing if record does not
              exist.

       [--if-exists] add table record column [key=]value...
              Adds the specified value or key-value pair to column  in  record
              in  table.   If column is a map, then key is required, otherwise
              it is prohibited.  If key already exists in a map  column,  then
              the  current  value  is  not  replaced  (use  the set command to
              replace an existing value).

              Without --if-exists, it is an error if record  does  not  exist.
              With  --if-exists,  this command does nothing if record does not
              exist.

       [--if-exists] remove table record column value...
       [--if-exists] remove table record column key...
       [--if-exists] remove table record column key=value...
              Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from  column  in
              record in table.  The first form applies to columns that are not
              maps: each specified value is removed from the column.  The sec‐
              ond and third forms apply to map columns: if only a key is spec‐
              ified, then any key-value pair with the given  key  is  removed,
              regardless  of  its  value;  if  a value is given then a pair is
              removed only if both key and value match.

              It is not an error if the column does not contain the  specified
              key or value or pair.

              Without  --if-exists,  it  is an error if record does not exist.
              With --if-exists, this command does nothing if record  does  not
              exist.

       [--if-exists] clear table record column...
              Sets  each  column  in record in table to the empty set or empty
              map, as appropriate.  This command applies only to columns  that
              are allowed to be empty.

              Without  --if-exists,  it  is an error if record does not exist.
              With --if-exists, this command does nothing if record  does  not
              exist.

       [--id=@name] create table column[:key]=value...
              Creates  a  new  record  in table and sets the initial values of
              each column.  Columns not  explicitly  set  will  receive  their
              default values.  Outputs the UUID of the new row.

              If  @name  is  specified,  then  the UUID for the new row may be
              referred to by that name elsewhere in the same ovs-vsctl invoca‐
              tion  in contexts where a UUID is expected.  Such references may
              precede or follow the create command.

              Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant  only  when
              they can be reached directly or indirectly from the Open_vSwitch
              table.  Except for records in the QoS or Queue  tables,  records
              that are not reachable from the Open_vSwitch table are automati‐
              cally deleted from the database.  This deletion happens  immedi‐
              ately,  without  waiting  for  additional  ovs-vsctl commands or
              other database activity.  Thus, a create command must  generally
              be  accompanied by additional commands within the same ovs-vsctl
              invocation to add a chain of references  to  the  newly  created
              record  from  the  top-level  Open_vSwitch record.  The EXAMPLES
              section gives some examples that show how to do this.

       [--if-exists] destroy table record...
              Deletes each specified record from table.  Unless --if-exists is
              specified, each records must exist.

       --all destroy table
              Deletes all records from the table.

              The  destroy  command  is  only useful for records in the QoS or
              Queue tables.  Records in other tables are automatically deleted
              from   the  database  when  they  become  unreachable  from  the
              Open_vSwitch table.  This means that deleting the last reference
              to  a  record is sufficient for deleting the record itself.  For
              records in these tables, destroy is silently ignored.   See  the
              EXAMPLES section below for more information.

       wait-until table record [column[:key]=value]...
              Waits  until  table  contains a record named record whose column
              equals value or, if key is specified, whose  column  contains  a
              key  with  the  specified value.  Any of the operators !=, <, >,
              <=, or >= may be substituted for = to test for inequality,  less
              than,  greater  than,  less than or equal to, or greater than or
              equal to, respectively.  (Don't forget to escape  <  or  >  from
              interpretation by the shell.)

              If no column[:key]=value arguments are given, this command waits
              only until record exists.  If more than  one  such  argument  is
              given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied.

              Usually wait-until should be placed at the beginning of a set of
              ovs-vsctl commands.  For example, wait-until bridge br0  --  get
              bridge  br0  datapath_id  waits until a bridge named br0 is cre‐
              ated, then prints its datapath_id column, whereas get bridge br0
              datapath_id  --  wait-until  bridge  br0 will abort if no bridge
              named br0 exists when ovs-vsctl initially connects to the  data‐
              base.

              Consider specifying --timeout=0 along with --wait-until, to pre‐
              vent ovs-vsctl from terminating after waiting  only  at  most  5
              seconds.

       comment [arg]...
              This  command  has  no  effect on behavior, but any database log
              record created by the command will include the command  and  its
              arguments.

EXAMPLES
       Create a new bridge named br0 and add port eth0 to it:

              ovs-vsctl add-br br0
              ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth0

       Alternatively, perform both operations in a single atomic transaction:

              ovs-vsctl add-br br0 -- add-port br0 eth0

       Delete bridge br0, reporting an error if it does not exist:

              ovs-vsctl del-br br0

       Delete bridge br0 if it exists:

              ovs-vsctl --if-exists del-br br0

       Set  the  qos  column of the Port record for eth0 to point to a new QoS
       record, which in turn points with its queue 0 to a new Queue record:

              ovs-vsctl -- set port eth0 qos=@newqos  --  --id=@newqos  create
              qos         type=linux-htb         other-config:max-rate=1000000
              queues:0=@newqueue --  --id=@newqueue  create  queue  other-con‐
              fig:min-rate=1000000 other-config:max-rate=1000000

CONFIGURATION COOKBOOK
   Port Configuration
       Add an ``internal port'' vlan10 to bridge br0 as a VLAN access port for
       VLAN 10, and configure it with an IP address:

              ovs-vsctl add-port br0 vlan10 tag=10  --  set  Interface  vlan10
              type=internal

              ifconfig vlan10 192.168.0.123

       Add a GRE tunnel port gre0 to remote IP address 1.2.3.4 to bridge br0:

              ovs-vsctl  add-port  br0  gre0  --  set  Interface gre0 type=gre
              options:remote_ip=1.2.3.4

   Port Mirroring
       Mirror all packets received or sent on eth0 or eth1 onto eth2, assuming
       that  all  of  those  ports  exist on bridge br0 (as a side-effect this
       causes any packets received on eth2 to be ignored):

              ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 mirrors=@m \

              -- --id=@eth0 get Port eth0 \

              -- --id=@eth1 get Port eth1 \

              -- --id=@eth2 get Port eth2 \

              --   --id=@m    create    Mirror    name=mymirror    select-dst-
              port=@eth0,@eth1 select-src-port=@eth0,@eth1 output-port=@eth2

       Remove  the mirror created above from br0, which also destroys the Mir‐
       ror record (since it is now unreferenced):

              ovs-vsctl -- --id=@rec get Mirror mymirror \

              -- remove Bridge br0 mirrors @rec

       The following simpler command also works:

              ovs-vsctl clear Bridge br0 mirrors

   Quality of Service (QoS)
       Create a linux-htb QoS record that points to a few queues and use it on
       eth0 and eth1:

              ovs-vsctl -- set Port eth0 qos=@newqos \

              -- set Port eth1 qos=@newqos \

              --    --id=@newqos    create   QoS   type=linux-htb   other-con‐
              fig:max-rate=1000000000 queues=0=@q0,1=@q1 \

              --   --id=@q0   create   Queue   other-config:min-rate=100000000
              other-config:max-rate=100000000 \

              -- --id=@q1 create Queue other-config:min-rate=500000000

       Deconfigure the QoS record above from eth1 only:

              ovs-vsctl clear Port eth1 qos

       To  deconfigure  the QoS record from both eth0 and eth1 and then delete
       the QoS record (which must be done explicitly because unreferenced  QoS
       records are not automatically destroyed):

              ovs-vsctl  --  destroy  QoS eth0 -- clear Port eth0 qos -- clear
              Port eth1 qos

       (This command will leave two unreferenced Queue records  in  the  data‐
       base.   To delete them, use "ovs-vsctl list Queue" to find their UUIDs,
       then "ovs-vsctl destroy Queue uuid1 uuid2" to destroy each of  them  or
       use "ovs-vsctl -- --all destroy Queue" to delete all records.)

   Connectivity Monitoring
       Monitor connectivity to a remote maintenance point on eth0.

              ovs-vsctl set Interface eth0 cfm_mpid=1

       Deconfigure connectivity monitoring from above:

              ovs-vsctl clear Interface eth0 cfm_mpid

   NetFlow
       Configure  bridge  br0 to send NetFlow records to UDP port 5566 on host
       192.168.0.34, with an active timeout of 30 seconds:

              ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 netflow=@nf \

              --   --id=@nf   create   NetFlow   targets=\"192.168.0.34:5566\"
              active-timeout=30

       Update  the  NetFlow  configuration  created by the previous command to
       instead use an active timeout of 60 seconds:

              ovs-vsctl set NetFlow br0 active_timeout=60

       Deconfigure the NetFlow settings from br0, which also destroys the Net‐
       Flow record (since it is now unreferenced):

              ovs-vsctl clear Bridge br0 netflow

   sFlow
       Configure  bridge  br0 to send sFlow records to a collector on 10.0.0.1
       at port 6343, using eth1´s IP address as the source, with specific sam‐
       pling parameters:

              ovs-vsctl    --    --id=@s    create   sFlow   agent=eth1   tar‐
              get=\"10.0.0.1:6343\" header=128 sampling=64 polling=10 \

              -- set Bridge br0 sflow=@s

       Deconfigure sFlow from br0, which also destroys the sFlow record (since
       it is now unreferenced):

              ovs-vsctl -- clear Bridge br0 sflow

   IPFIX
       Configure bridge br0 to send one IPFIX flow record per packet sample to
       UDP port 4739 on host 192.168.0.34, with Observation Domain ID 123  and
       Observation  Point  ID 456, a flow cache active timeout of 1 minute (60
       seconds), maximum flow cache size of 13 flows,  and  flows  sampled  on
       output  port  with  tunnel  info(sampling  on  input and output port is
       enabled by default if not disabled) :

              ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 ipfix=@i \

              --   --id=@i    create    IPFIX    targets=\"192.168.0.34:4739\"
              obs_domain_id=123    obs_point_id=456    cache_active_timeout=60
              cache_max_flows=13 \

              other_config:enable-input-sampling=false    other_config:enable-
              tunnel-sampling=true

       Deconfigure  the IPFIX settings from br0, which also destroys the IPFIX
       record (since it is now unreferenced):

              ovs-vsctl clear Bridge br0 ipfix

   802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
       Configure bridge br0 to participate in an 802.1D spanning tree:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 stp_enable=true

       Set the bridge priority of br0 to 0x7800:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:stp-priority=0x7800

       Set the path cost of port eth0 to 10:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:stp-path-cost=10

       Deconfigure STP from above:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 stp_enable=false

   Multicast Snooping
       Configure bridge br0 to enable multicast snooping:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 mcast_snooping_enable=true

       Set the multicast snooping aging time br0 to 300 seconds:

              ovs-vsctl  set  Bridge  br0   other_config:mcast-snooping-aging-
              time=300

       Set the multicast snooping table size br0 to 2048 entries:

              ovs-vsctl   set  Bridge  br0  other_config:mcast-snooping-table-
              size=2048

       Disable flooding of unregistered multicast packets to all  ports.  When
       set  to  true, the switch will send unregistered multicast packets only
       to ports connected to multicast routers. When it is set to  false,  the
       switch  will send them to all ports. This command disables the flood of
       unregistered packets on bridge br0.

              ovs-vsctl set  Bridge  br0  other_config:mcast-snooping-disable-
              flood-unregistered=true

       Enable flooding of multicast packets on a specific port.

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth1 other_config:mcast-snooping-flood=true

       Deconfigure multicasting snooping from above:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 mcast_snooping_enable=false

   802.1D-2004 Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
       Configure  bridge  br0  to participate in an 802.1D-2004 Rapid Spanning
       Tree:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 rstp_enable=true

       Set the bridge address of br0 to 00:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa :

              ovs-vsctl      set      Bridge      br0       other_config:rstp-
              address=00:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa

       Set  the  bridge priority of br0 to 0x7000. The value must be specified
       in decimal notation and should be a multiple of 4096  (if  not,  it  is
       rounded  down  to  the  nearest multiple of 4096). The default priority
       value is 0x800 (32768).

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:rstp-priority=28672

       Set the bridge ageing time of br0 to 1000  s.  The  ageing  time  value
       should be between 10 s and 1000000 s. The default value is 300 s.

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:rstp-ageing-time=1000

       Set  the  bridge force protocol version of br0 to 0. The force protocol
       version has two acceptable values: 0 (STP  compatibility  mode)  and  2
       (normal operation).

              ovs-vsctl  set  Bridge br0 other_config:rstp-force-protocol-ver‐
              sion=0

       Set the bridge max age of br0 to 10 s. The  max  age  value  should  be
       between 6 s and 40 s. The default value is 20 s.

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:rstp-max-age=10

       Set  the  bridge  forward  delay  of br0 to 15 s.  This value should be

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:rstp-forward-delay=15

       Set the bridge transmit hold count of br0 to 7 s. This value should  be
       between 1 s and 10 s. The default value is 6 s.

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:rstp-transmit-hold-count=7

       Enable RSTP on the Port eth0:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-enable=true

       Disable RSTP on the Port eth0:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-enable=false

       Set  the  priority  of  port eth0 to 32. The value must be specified in
       decimal notation and should be a multiple of 16 (if not, it is  rounded
       down to the nearest multiple of 16). The default priority value is 0x80
       (128).

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-port-priority=32

       Set the port number of port eth0 to 3:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-port-num=3

       Set the path cost of port eth0 to 150:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-path-cost=150

       Set the admin edge value of port eth0:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-port-admin-edge=true

       Set the auto edge value of port eth0:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-port-auto-edge=true

       Set the admin point to point MAC value of port eth0.  Acceptable values
       are  0 (not point-to-point), 1 (point-to-point, the default value) or 2
       (automatic detection).  The auto-detection mode is not currently imple‐
       mented, and the value 2 has the same effect of 0 (not point-to-point).

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-admin-p2p-mac=1

       Set  the  admin  port  state  value  of port eth0.  true is the default

       Set the mcheck value of port eth0:

              ovs-vsctl set Port eth0 other_config:rstp-port-mcheck=true

       Deconfigure RSTP from above:

              ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 rstp_enable=false

   OpenFlow Version
       Configure bridge br0 to support OpenFlow versions 1.0, 1.2, and 1.3:

              ovs-vsctl set bridge  br0  protocols=OpenFlow10,OpenFlow12,Open‐
              Flow13
