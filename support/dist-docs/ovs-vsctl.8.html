<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-vsctl - utility for querying and configuring <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  [<u>options</u>]  <b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>args</u>] [<b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u>
       [<u>args</u>]]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  program  configures  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>(8)  by  providing   a
       high-level    interface    to    its   configuration   database.    See
       <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database
       schema.

       <b>ovs-vsctl</b> connects to an <b>ovsdb-server</b> process that  maintains  an  Open
       vSwitch  configuration database.  Using this connection, it queries and
       possibly applies changes to the database,  depending  on  the  supplied
       commands.   Then,  if it applied any changes, by default it waits until
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> has finished reconfiguring itself before  it  exits.   (If
       you use <b>ovs-vsctl</b> when <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is not running, use <b>--no-wait</b>.)

       <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  can  perform  any number of commands in a single run, imple‐
       mented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The <b>ovs-vsctl</b> command line begins with global options (see <b>OPTIONS</b>  be‐
       low  for details).  The global options are followed by one or more com‐
       mands.  Each command should begin with <b>--</b> by itself as  a  command-line
       argument,  to  separate it from the following commands.  (The <b>--</b> before
       the first command is optional.)  The command itself  starts  with  com‐
       mand-specific options, if any, followed by the command name and any ar‐
       guments.  See <b>EXAMPLES</b> below for syntax examples.

   <b>Linux</b> <b>VLAN</b> <b>Bridging</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       The  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  program  supports  the model of a bridge implemented by
       Open vSwitch, in which a  single  bridge  supports  ports  on  multiple
       VLANs.   In  this  model,  each port on a bridge is either a trunk port
       that potentially passes packets tagged with 802.1Q headers that  desig‐
       nate  VLANs  or  it  is  assigned  a single implicit VLAN that is never
       tagged with an 802.1Q header.

       For  compatibility  with  software  designed  for  the  Linux   bridge,
       <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  also  supports  a  model  in which traffic associated with a
       given 802.1Q VLAN is segregated into a separate bridge.  A special form
       of the <b>add-br</b> command (see below) creates a ``fake bridge''  within  an
       Open  vSwitch  bridge  to  simulate  this behavior.  When such a ``fake
       bridge'' is active, <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will treat it much like a bridge separate
       from its ``parent bridge,''  but  the  actual  implementation  in  Open
       vSwitch  uses  only  a single bridge, with ports on the fake bridge as‐
       signed the implicit VLAN of the fake bridge of which they are  members.
       (A fake bridge for VLAN 0 receives packets that have no 802.1Q tag or a
       tag with VLAN 0.)

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       The  following  options affect the behavior <b>ovs-vsctl</b> as a whole.  Some
       individual commands also accept their own options, which are given just
       before the command name.  If the first command on the command line  has
       options,  then  those options must be separated from the global options
       by <b>--</b>.

       <b>--db=</b><u>server</u>
              Sets <u>server</u> as the database server that  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  contacts  to
              query or modify configuration.  <u>server</u> may be an OVSDB active or
              passive  connection  method,  as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  The de‐
              fault is <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Prevents <b>ovs-vsctl</b> from waiting for <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to  reconfigure
              itself  according  to the modified database.  This option should
              be used if <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is  not  running;  otherwise,  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
              will not exit until <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> starts.

              This  option  has  no  effect  if  the commands specified do not
              change the database.

       <b>--no-syslog</b>
              By default, <b>ovs-vsctl</b> logs its arguments and the details of  any
              changes  that  it makes to the system log.  This option disables
              this logging.

              This option is equivalent to <b>--verbose=vsctl:syslog:warn</b>.

       <b>--oneline</b>
              Modifies the output format so that the output for  each  command
              is  printed  on  a  single line.  New-line characters that would
              otherwise separate lines are printed as <b>\n</b>, and any instances of
              <b>\</b> that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.  Prints
              a blank line for each command that has no output.   This  option
              does  not  affect the formatting of output from the <b>list</b> or <b>find</b>
              commands; see <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> below.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Prevents <b>ovs-vsctl</b> from actually modifying the database.

       <b>-t</b> <u>secs</u>
       <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              By default, or with a <u>secs</u> of <b>0</b>, <b>ovs-vsctl</b> waits forever  for  a
              response  from  the database.  This option limits runtime to ap‐
              proximately <u>secs</u> seconds.  If  the  timeout  expires,  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
              will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal.  (A timeout would normally hap‐
              pen  only  if the database cannot be contacted, or if the system
              is overloaded.)

       <b>--retry</b>
              Without this option, if <b>ovs-vsctl</b> connects outward to the  data‐
              base  server  (the  default)  then <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will try to connect
              once and exit with an error if the connection fails (which  usu‐
              ally means that <b>ovsdb-server</b> is not running).

              With  this  option,  or  if <b>--db</b> specifies that <b>ovs-vsctl</b> should
              listen for an incoming connection from the database server, then
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will wait for a connection to the database forever.

              Regardless of this setting, <b>--timeout</b>  always  limits  how  long
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will wait.

   <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b>
       These  options control the format of output from the <b>list</b> and <b>find</b> com‐
       mands.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
              Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of  <u>for‐</u>
              <u>mat</u> are available:

              <b>table</b>  2-D text tables with aligned columns.

              <b>list</b> (default)
                     A  list  with one column per line and rows separated by a
                     blank line.

              <b>html</b>   HTML tables.

              <b>csv</b>    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

              <b>json</b>   JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a  se‐
                     quence  of JSON objects, each of which corresponds to one
                     table.  Each JSON object has the following  members  with
                     the noted values:

                     <b>caption</b>
                            The  table's  caption.   This member is omitted if
                            the table has no caption.

                     <b>headings</b>
                            An array with one element per table column.   Each
                            array element is a string giving the corresponding
                            column's heading.

                     <b>data</b>   An array with one element per table row.  Each el‐
                            ement  is also an array with one element per table
                            column.  The elements of this  second-level  array
                            are  the  cells  that constitute the table.  Cells
                            that represent OVSDB data or data  types  are  ex‐
                            pressed in the format described in the OVSDB spec‐
                            ification;  other  cells  are  simply expressed as
                            text strings.

       <b>-d</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--data=</b><u>format</u>
              Sets the formatting for cells within output  tables  unless  the
              table  format  is  set to <b>json</b>, in which case <b>json</b> formatting is
              always used when formatting cells.  The following types of  <u>for‐</u>
              <u>mat</u> are available:

              <b>string</b> (default)
                     The  simple  format described in the <b>Database</b> <b>Values</b> sec‐
                     tion below.

              <b>bare</b>   The simple format with punctuation stripped off:  <b>[]</b>  and
                     <b>{}</b>  are  omitted  around  sets,  maps, and empty columns,
                     items within  sets  and  maps  are  space-separated,  and
                     strings  are never quoted.  This format may be easier for
                     scripts to parse.

              <b>json</b>   The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

       <b>--no-headings</b>
              This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in
              the first row of table output.

       <b>--pretty</b>
              By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as  possible.
              This  option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more read‐
              able fashion.  Members of objects and  elements  of  arrays  are
              printed one per line, with indentation.

              This  option  does  not  affect  JSON in tables, which is always
              printed compactly.

       <b>--bare</b> Equivalent to <b>--format=list</b> <b>--data=bare</b> <b>--no-headings</b>.

       <b>--max-column-width=</b><u>n</u>
              For table output only, limits the width of  any  column  in  the
              output  to  <u>n</u> columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to fit, as
              necessary.  Columns are always wide enough to display the column
              names, if the heading row is printed.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented to it by
              SSL/TLS peers.  (This may be the same certificate  that  SSL/TLS
              peers  use  to  verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--cer‐</b>
              <b>tificate</b>, or it may be a different one, depending on the PKI de‐
              sign in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.   This  introduces a security risk, because it means that
              certificates cannot be verified to be  those  of  known  trusted
              hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              When <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will attempt to
              obtain  the  CA  certificate  from the SSL/TLS peer on its first
              SSL/TLS connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it  is
              successful,  it  will immediately drop the connection and recon‐
              nect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be authenti‐
              cated by a certificate signed by the  CA  certificate  thus  ob‐
              tained.

              <b>This</b>  <b>option</b> <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man-in-the-mid‐</b>
              <b>dle</b> <b>attack</b> <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it  may  be
              useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA cer‐
              tificate as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS pro‐
              tocols do not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM file that contains one or more additional cer‐
              tificates to send to SSL/TLS peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u>  should  be
              the  CA  certificate  used  to sign <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s own certificate,
              that is, the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or  <b>--certificate</b>.   If
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s  certificate  is self-signed, then <b>--certificate</b> and
              <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This option is not  useful  in  normal  operation,  because  the
              SSL/TLS  peer  must already have the CA certificate for the peer
              to have any confidence in <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s identity.   However,  this
              offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap the CA certifi‐
              cate on its first SSL/TLS connection.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.   (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,   <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
                     closes  its  standard file descriptors, so logging to the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name   used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is  <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-vsctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution needs to be taken into account, for ex‐
                     ample, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen  on
                     the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could
                     be interfering with local syslog traffic  and  there  are
                     some  security  considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>COMMANDS</b>
       The commands implemented by <b>ovs-vsctl</b> are described in the sections be‐
       low.

   <b>Open</b> <b>vSwitch</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands work with an Open vSwitch as a whole.

       <b>init</b>   Initializes  the  Open vSwitch database, if it is empty.  If the
              database has already been initialized, this command has  no  ef‐
              fect.

              Any  successful  <b>ovs-vsctl</b> command automatically initializes the
              Open vSwitch database if it is empty.  This command is  provided
              to initialize the database without executing any other command.

       <b>show</b>   Prints a brief overview of the database contents.

       <b>emer-reset</b>
              Reset  the  configuration  into  a clean state.  It deconfigures
              OpenFlow controllers, OVSDB servers, and  SSL/TLS,  and  deletes
              port  mirroring, <b>fail_mode</b>, NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX configura‐
              tion.  This command also removes all <b>other-config</b> keys from  all
              database  records,  except that <b>other-config:hwaddr</b> is preserved
              if it is present in a Bridge record.  Other networking  configu‐
              ration is left as-is.

   <b>Bridge</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch bridges.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-br</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Creates  a  new  bridge named <u>bridge</u>.  Initially the bridge will
              have no ports (other than <u>bridge</u> itself).

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a bridge  that  exists
              is  an  error.   With  <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if
              <u>bridge</u> already exists as a real bridge.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-br</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>parent</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Creates a ``fake bridge'' named <u>bridge</u> within the existing  Open
              vSwitch bridge <u>parent</u>, which must already exist and must not it‐
              self  be  a  fake bridge.  The new fake bridge will be on 802.1Q
              VLAN <u>vlan</u>, which must be an integer between  0  and  4095.   The
              parent  bridge  must  not  already  have a fake bridge for <u>vlan</u>.
              Initially <u>bridge</u> will have no ports (other than <u>bridge</u> itself).

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a bridge  that  exists
              is  an  error.   With  <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if
              <u>bridge</u> already exists as a VLAN bridge under <u>parent</u> for <u>vlan</u>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-br</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Deletes <u>bridge</u> and all of  its  ports.   If  <u>bridge</u>  is  a  real
              bridge,  this  command  also  deletes any fake bridges that were
              created with <u>bridge</u> as parent, including all of their ports.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a bridge that does not
              exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>,  attempting  to  delete  a
              bridge that does not exist has no effect.

       [<b>--real</b>|<b>--fake</b>] <b>list-br</b>
              Lists all existing real and fake bridges on standard output, one
              per  line.  With <b>--real</b> or <b>--fake</b>, only bridges of that type are
              returned.

       <b>br-exists</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Tests whether <u>bridge</u> exists as a real or fake  bridge.   If  so,
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>   exits  successfully  with  exit  code  0.   If  not,
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> exits unsuccessfully with exit code 2.

       <b>br-to-vlan</b> <u>bridge</u>
              If <u>bridge</u> is a fake bridge, prints the bridge's 802.1Q VLAN as a
              decimal integer.  If <u>bridge</u> is a real bridge, prints 0.

       <b>br-to-parent</b> <u>bridge</u>
              If <u>bridge</u> is a fake  bridge,  prints  the  name  of  its  parent
              bridge.  If <u>bridge</u> is a real bridge, print <u>bridge</u>.

       <b>br-set-external-id</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>key</u> [<u>value</u>]
              Sets or clears an ``external ID'' value on <u>bridge</u>.  These values
              are  intended to identify entities external to Open vSwitch with
              which <u>bridge</u> is associated, e.g. the bridge's  identifier  in  a
              virtualization  management  platform.  The Open vSwitch database
              schema specifies well-known <u>key</u> values, but <u>key</u>  and  <u>value</u>  are
              otherwise arbitrary strings.

              If  <u>value</u>  is  specified,  then  <u>key</u> is set to <u>value</u> for <u>bridge</u>,
              overwriting any previous value.  If <u>value</u> is omitted,  then  <u>key</u>
              is  removed  from  <u>bridge</u>'s  set  of  external  IDs  (if  it was
              present).

              For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to  that
              of  a  <b>set</b>  or  <b>remove</b> command in the <b>external-ids</b> column of the
              <b>Bridge</b> table.  For fake bridges, it actually modifies keys  with
              names prefixed by <b>fake-bridge-</b> in the <b>Port</b> table.

       <b>br-get-external-id</b> <u>bridge</u> [<u>key</u>]
              Queries  the  external  IDs on <u>bridge</u>.  If <u>key</u> is specified, the
              output is the value for that <u>key</u> or the empty string if  <u>key</u>  is
              unset.   If  <u>key</u>  is  omitted,  the output is <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, one per
              line, for each key-value pair.

              For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to  that
              of a <b>get</b> command in the <b>external-ids</b> column of the <b>Bridge</b> table.
              For  fake  bridges,  it  queries  keys  with  names  prefixed by
              <b>fake-bridge-</b> in the <b>Port</b> table.

   <b>Port</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch ports.   These  com‐
       mands treat a bonded port as a single entity.

       <b>list-ports</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists all of the ports within <u>bridge</u> on standard output, one per
              line.  The local port <u>bridge</u> is not included in the list.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-port</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>port</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]=<u>value</u>]...
              Creates  on <u>bridge</u> a new port named <u>port</u> from the network device
              of the same name.

              Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record  cre‐
              ated  by the command.  For example, <b>tag=9</b> would make the port an
              access port for VLAN 9.  The syntax is the same as that for  the
              <b>set</b> command (see <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b> below).

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a port that exists is
              an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing  if  <u>port</u>
              already exists on <u>bridge</u> and is not a bonded port.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-port</b> [<u>bridge</u>] <u>port</u>
              Deletes  <u>port</u>.  If <u>bridge</u> is omitted, <u>port</u> is removed from what‐
              ever bridge contains it; if <u>bridge</u> is specified, it must be  the
              real or fake bridge that contains <u>port</u>.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  attempting to delete a port that does not
              exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>,  attempting  to  delete  a
              port that does not exist has no effect.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>--with-iface</b> <b>del-port</b> [<u>bridge</u>] <u>iface</u>
              Deletes  the  port  named  <u>iface</u>  or that has an interface named
              <u>iface</u>.  If <u>bridge</u> is omitted, the port is removed from  whatever
              bridge  contains it; if <u>bridge</u> is specified, it must be the real
              or fake bridge that contains the port.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete the port for an inter‐
              face that does not exist is an  error.   With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  at‐
              tempting to delete the port for an interface that does not exist
              has no effect.

       <b>port-to-br</b> <u>port</u>
              Prints  the  name  of  the bridge that contains <u>port</u> on standard
              output.

   <b>Bond</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands work with ports that have more than one interface, which
       Open vSwitch calls ``bonds.''

       [<b>--fake-iface</b>] <b>add-bond</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>port</u> <u>iface</u>... [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]=<u>value</u>]...
              Creates on <u>bridge</u> a new port named <u>port</u> that bonds together  the
              network  devices  given  as each <u>iface</u>.  At least two interfaces
              must be named.  If the interfaces  are  DPDK  enabled  then  the
              transaction  will  need  to include operations to explicitly set
              the interface type to 'dpdk'.

              Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record  cre‐
              ated by the command.  The syntax is the same as that for the <b>set</b>
              command (see <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b> below).

              With  <b>--fake-iface</b>,  a fake interface with the name <u>port</u> is cre‐
              ated.  This should only be used for  compatibility  with  legacy
              software that requires it.

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a port that exists is
              an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing  if  <u>port</u>
              already  exists  on <u>bridge</u> and bonds together exactly the speci‐
              fied interfaces.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-bond-iface</b> <u>bond</u> <u>iface</u>
              Adds <u>iface</u> as a new bond interface to the  existing  port  <u>bond</u>.
              If  <u>bond</u> previously had only one port, this transforms it into a
              bond.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to add an <u>iface</u> that is  already
              part  of  <u>bond</u> is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does
              nothing if <u>iface</u> is already part of <u>bond</u>.  (It is still an error
              if <u>iface</u> is an interface of some other port or bond.)

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-bond-iface</b> [<u>bond</u>] <u>iface</u>
              Removes <u>iface</u> from its port.  If <u>bond</u> is omitted, <u>iface</u>  is  re‐
              moved  from  whatever port contains it; if <u>bond</u> is specified, it
              must be the port that contains <u>bond</u>.

              If removing <u>iface</u> causes its port to have only a  single  inter‐
              face,  then  that  port  transforms from a bond into an ordinary
              port.  It is an error if <u>iface</u> is  the  only  interface  in  its
              port.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete an interface that does
              not  exist  is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete
              an interface that does not exist has no effect.

   <b>Interface</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine the  interfaces  attached  to  an  Open  vSwitch
       bridge.   These  commands treat a bonded port as a collection of two or
       more interfaces, rather than as a single port.

       <b>list-ifaces</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists all of the interfaces within <u>bridge</u>  on  standard  output,
              one  per  line.   The  local  port <u>bridge</u> is not included in the
              list.

       <b>iface-to-br</b> <u>iface</u>
              Prints the name of the bridge that contains  <u>iface</u>  on  standard
              output.

   <b>Conntrack</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and modify datapath CT zones, Timeout Policies and
       Limits.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-zone-tp</b> <u>datapath</u> <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> <u>policies</u>
              Creates  a  conntrack  zone timeout policy with <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> in <u>data‐</u>
              <u>path</u>.  The <u>policies</u> consist of  <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>  pairs,  separated  by
              spaces.   For  example,  <b>icmp_first=30</b> <b>icmp_reply=60</b> specifies a
              30-second timeout policy for the first ICMP packet and a 60-sec‐
              ond policy for ICMP reply packets.   See  the  <b>CT_Timeout_Policy</b>
              table in <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) for the supported keys.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to add a <u>policy</u> for <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> that
              already has a policy is an error.
               With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if policy for
               <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> already exists.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-zone-tp</b> <u>datapath</u> <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>
              Delete the timeout policy associated with <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> from <u>datapath</u>.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a policy for zone that
              does  not  exist  or  doesn't  have  a policy is an error.  With
              <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a a policy that does not exist
              has no effect.

       <b>list-zone-tp</b> <u>datapath</u>
              Prints the timeout policies of all zones in <u>datapath</u>.

       <b>set-zone-limit</b> <u>datapath</u> <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>|<b>default</b> <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u>
              Sets a conntrack zone limit with  <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>|<u>default</u>  in  <u>datapath</u>.
              The <u>limit</u> with value <b>0</b> means unlimited.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-zone-limit</b> <u>datapath</u> <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>|<b>default</b>
              Delete the limit associated with <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> from <u>datapath</u>.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a limit for zone that
              does not exist or doesn't  have  a  limit  is  an  error.   With
              <b>--if-exists</b>,  attempting  to  delete a limit that does not exist
              has no effect.

       <b>list-zone-limits</b> <u>datapath</u>
              Prints the limits of all zones in <u>datapath</u>.

   <b>Datapath</b> <b>Capabilities</b> <b>Command</b>
       The command query datapath capabilities.

       <b>list-dp-cap</b> <u>datapath</u>
              Prints the datapath's capabilities.

   <b>OpenFlow</b> <b>Controller</b> <b>Connectivity</b>
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> can perform all configured bridging and switching locally,
       or it can be configured to communicate with one or more external  Open‐
       Flow  controllers.   The switch is typically configured to connect to a
       primary controller that takes charge of the bridge's flow table to  im‐
       plement a network policy.  In addition, the switch can be configured to
       listen  to  connections  from service controllers.  Service controllers
       are typically used for occasional support and  maintenance,  e.g.  with
       <b>ovs-ofctl</b>.

       <b>get-controller</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Prints the configured controller target.

       <b>del-controller</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Deletes the configured controller target.

       <b>set-controller</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>target</u>...
              Sets  the  configured controller target or targets.  Each <u>target</u>
              may use any of the following forms:

              <b>ssl:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
              <b>tcp:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The specified <u>port</u> on the given <u>host</u>, which  can  be  ex‐
                     pressed  either  as a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary) or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6  address  format.
                     Wrap    IPv6   addresses   in   square   brackets,   e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.  On Linux, use  <b>%</b><u>device</u>  to  designate  a
                     scope     for    IPv6    link-level    addresses,    e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653</b>.  For <b>ssl</b>, the  <b>--private-key</b>,
                     <b>--certificate</b>, and <b>--ca-cert</b> options are mandatory.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named <u>file</u>.

                     On  Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is repre‐
                     sented by a file created in the path <u>file</u>  to  mimic  the
                     behavior of a Unix domain socket.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
              <b>ptcp:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections on <u>port</u>.  The default
                     <u>port</u> is 6653.  By default, connections are  allowed  from
                     any  IPv4  address.  Specify <u>host</u> as an IPv4 address or a
                     bracketed IPv6 address (e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>).  On Linux,
                     use <b>%</b><u>device</u> to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level  ad‐
                     dresses, e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]</b>.  DNS names can
                     be  used  if  built  with unbound library.  For <b>pssl</b>, the
                     <b>--private-key</b>,<b>--certificate</b>, and  <b>--ca-cert</b>  options  are
                     mandatory.

              <b>punix:</b><u>file</u>
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections  on  the  Unix domain
                     server socket named <u>file</u>.

     <u>Controller</u> <u>Failure</u> <u>Settings</u>

       When a controller is configured, it  is,  ordinarily,  responsible  for
       setting  up  all  flows  on the switch.  Thus, if the connection to the
       controller fails, no new network connections can be  set  up.   If  the
       connection  to  the  controller  stays down long enough, no packets can
       pass through the switch at all.

       If the value is <b>standalone</b>, or if neither of  these  settings  is  set,
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will take over responsibility for setting up flows when no
       message has been received from the controller for three times the inac‐
       tivity  probe interval.  In this mode, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> causes the datapath
       to act like an ordinary MAC-learning switch.   <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  will  con‐
       tinue to retry connecting to the controller in the background and, when
       the connection succeeds, it discontinues its standalone behavior.

       If  this option is set to <b>secure</b>, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will not set up flows on
       its own when the controller connection fails.

       <b>get-fail-mode</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Prints the configured failure mode.

       <b>del-fail-mode</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Deletes the configured failure mode.

       <b>set-fail-mode</b> <u>bridge</u> <b>standalone</b>|<b>secure</b>
              Sets the configured failure mode.

   <b>Manager</b> <b>Connectivity</b>
       These  commands  manipulate   the   <b>manager_options</b>   column   in   the
       <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table  and rows in the <b>Managers</b> table.  When <b>ovsdb-server</b>
       is configured to use the <b>manager_options</b> column for  OVSDB  connections
       (as  described  in  the startup scripts provided with Open vSwitch; the
       corresponding     <b>ovsdb-server</b>     command     option     is      <b>--re‐</b>
       <b>mote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options</b>), this allows the ad‐
       ministrator to use <b>ovs-vsctl</b> to configure database connections.

       <b>get-manager</b>
              Prints the configured manager(s).

       <b>del-manager</b>
              Deletes the configured manager(s).

       <b>set-manager</b> <u>target</u>...
              Sets  the configured manager target or targets.  Each <u>target</u> may
              be an OVSDB active or passive connection method, e.g. <b>pssl:6640</b>,
              as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

   <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       When <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is configured to connect over SSL/TLS for  management
       or controller connectivity, the following parameters are required:

       <u>private-key</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as the vir‐
              tual  switch's  identity  for  SSL/TLS  connections  to the con‐
              troller.

       <u>certificate</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a  certificate,  signed  by  the
              certificate  authority  (CA) used by the controller and manager,
              that certifies the virtual switch's private key,  identifying  a
              trustworthy switch.

       <u>ca-cert</u>
              Specifies  a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to ver‐
              ify that the virtual switch is connected to a  trustworthy  con‐
              troller.

       These files are read only once, at <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> startup time.  If their
       contents change, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> must be killed and restarted.

       These  SSL/TLS  settings  apply  to all SSL/TLS connections made by the
       virtual switch.

       <b>get-ssl</b>
              Prints the SSL/TLS configuration.

       <b>del-ssl</b>
              Deletes the current SSL/TLS configuration.

       [<b>--bootstrap</b>] <b>set-ssl</b> <u>private-key</u> <u>certificate</u> <u>ca-cert</u>
              Sets the SSL/TLS configuration.  The <b>--bootstrap</b> option  is  de‐
              scribed below.

     <u>CA</u> <u>Certificate</u> <u>Bootstrap</u>

       Ordinarily,  all  of  the files named in the SSL/TLS configuration must
       exist when <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> starts.  However, if the <u>ca-cert</u> file does  not
       exist  and  the <b>--bootstrap</b> option is given, then <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will at‐
       tempt to obtain the CA certificate from the  controller  on  its  first
       SSL/TLS  connection  and  save it to the named PEM file.  If it is suc‐
       cessful, it will immediately drop the  connection  and  reconnect,  and
       from  then  on  all SSL/TLS connections must be authenticated by a cer‐
       tificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

       <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b>  <b>man-in-the-middle</b>  <b>at‐</b>
       <b>tack</b>  <b>obtaining</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>initial</b>  <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be useful for
       bootstrapping.

       This option is only useful if the controller sends its  CA  certificate
       as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS protocols do not re‐
       quire the controller to send the CA certificate.

   <b>Auto-Attach</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The  IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard describes a compact method of
       using IEEE 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a
       IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically  at‐
       tach  network devices to individual services in a SPB network.  The in‐
       tent here is to allow network applications and devices using OVS to  be
       able  to easily take advantage of features offered by industry standard
       SPB networks. A fundamental element of the Auto-Attach  feature  is  to
       map  traditional VLANs onto SPB I_SIDs. These commands manage the Auto-
       Attach I-SID/VLAN mappings.

       <b>add-aa-mapping</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>i-sid</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Creates a new Auto-Attach mapping on <u>bridge</u> for <u>i-sid</u> and <u>vlan</u>.

       <b>del-aa-mapping</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>i-sid</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Deletes an Auto-Attach mapping on <u>bridge</u> for <u>i-sid</u> and <u>vlan</u>.

       <b>get-aa-mapping</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists all of the Auto-Attach mappings within <u>bridge</u> on  standard
              output.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb</b> tables.  They are
       a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb</b> interface and as such they operate at
       a lower level than other <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands.

     <u>Identifying</u> <u>Tables,</u> <u>Records,</u> <u>and</u> <u>Columns</u>

       Each of these commands has a <u>table</u> parameter to identify a table within
       the  database.   Many of them also take a <u>record</u> parameter that identi‐
       fies a particular record within a table.  The <u>record</u> parameter  may  be
       the  UUID  for a record, and many tables offer additional ways to iden‐
       tify records.  Some commands also take <u>column</u> parameters that  identify
       a particular field within the records in a table.

       For  a list of tables and their columns, see <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) or
       see the table listing from the <b>--help</b> option.

       Record names must be specified in full and with correct capitalization,
       except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first  4  (or  more)  hex
       digits,  as  long  as that is unique within the table.  Names of tables
       and columns are not case-sensitive, and <b>-</b>  and  <b>_</b>  are  treated  inter‐
       changeably.  Unique abbreviations of table and column names are accept‐
       able, e.g. <b>net</b> or <b>n</b> is sufficient to identify the <b>NetFlow</b> table.

     <u>Database</u> <u>Values</u>

       Each  column  in  the  database accepts a fixed type of data.  The cur‐
       rently defined basic types, and their representations, are:

       integer
              A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1, inclusive.

       real   A floating-point number.

       Boolean
              True or false, written <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, respectively.

       string An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are not  al‐
              lowed.   Quotes are optional for most strings that begin with an
              English letter or underscore and consist only of letters, under‐
              scores, hyphens, and  periods.   However,  <b>true</b>  and  <b>false</b>  and
              strings  that  match the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be en‐
              closed in double quotes to distinguish  them  from  other  basic
              types.   When  double  quotes  are  used,  the syntax is that of
              strings in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to escape  special
              characters.   The  empty string must be represented as a pair of
              double quotes (<b>""</b>).

       UUID   Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122,
              e.g. <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>, or an  <b>@</b><u>name</u>  defined
              by a <b>get</b> or <b>create</b> command within the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a sin‐
       gle  comma.   When  multiple values are present, duplicates are not al‐
       lowed, and order is not important.  Conversely, some  database  columns
       can have an empty set of values, represented as <b>[]</b>, and square brackets
       may  optionally  enclose other non-empty sets or single values as well.
       For a column accepting a set of integers, database  commands  accept  a
       range.  A  range is represented by two integers separated by <b>-</b>. A range
       is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of 4096 elements. If more ele‐
       ments are needed, they can be specified in separate ranges.

       A few database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where  the  key
       and  the  value are each some fixed database type.  These are specified
       in the form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, where <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> follow the  syntax  for  the
       column's  key  type  and value type, respectively.  When multiple pairs
       are present (separated by spaces or a comma), duplicate  keys  are  not
       allowed,  and  again  the order is not important.  Duplicate values are
       allowed.  An empty map is represented as <b>{}</b>.  Curly braces may  option‐
       ally  enclose  non-empty  maps  as  well (but use quotes to prevent the
       shell  from  expanding  <b>other-config={0=x,1=y}</b>  into   <b>other-config=0=x</b>
       <b>other-config=1=y</b>, which may not have the desired effect).

     <u>Database</u> <u>Command</u> <u>Syntax</u>

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>list</b> <u>table</u> [<u>record</u>]...
              Lists  the  data  in  each  specified <u>record</u>.  If no records are
              specified, lists all the records in <u>table</u>.

              If <b>--columns</b>  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns  are
              listed,  in  the  specified  order.   Otherwise, all columns are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if any specified <u>record</u> does
              not exist.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, the  command  ignores  any  <u>record</u>
              that does not exist, without producing any output.

       [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>find</b> <u>table</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
              Lists the data in each record in <u>table</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u>
              or,  if  <u>key</u>  is specified, whose <u>column</u> contains a <u>key</u> with the
              specified <u>value</u>.  The following operators may be used where <b>=</b> is
              written in the syntax summary:

              <b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>
                     Selects records in which <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  equals,  does  not
                     equal,  is  less  than,  is greater than, is less than or
                     equal to, or is greater than or equal to  <u>value</u>,  respec‐
                     tively.

                     Consider  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  and  <u>value</u>  as  sets of elements.
                     Identical sets are considered equal.  Otherwise,  if  the
                     sets  have  different  numbers  of elements, then the set
                     with more elements is considered to  be  larger.   Other‐
                     wise,  consider  a element from each set pairwise, in in‐
                     creasing order within each set.  The first pair that dif‐
                     fers determines the result.  (For a column that  contains
                     key-value  pairs,  first  all  the keys are compared, and
                     values are considered only if the two sets contain  iden‐
                     tical keys.)

              <b>{=}</b> <b>{!=}</b>
                     Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

              <b>{&lt;=}</b>   Selects  records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is a subset of
                     <u>value</u>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2</b>  selects  records
                     in  which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty set or con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 or both.

              <b>{&lt;}</b>    Selects records in which <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is a proper  subset
                     of <u>value</u>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2</b> selects records
                     in  which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty set or con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 but not both.

              <b>{&gt;=}</b> <b>{&gt;}</b>
                     Same as <b>{&lt;=}</b> and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except that the rela‐
                     tionship is reversed.   For  example,  <b>flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2</b>
                     selects  records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column contains
                     both 1 and 2.

              The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch  2.16
              and later:

              <b>{in}</b>   Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is
                     also in <u>value</u>.  (This is the same as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

              <b>{not-in}</b>
                     Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is
                     not in <u>value</u>.

              For arithmetic operators (<b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>), when <u>key</u> is specified
              but  a  particular  record's  <u>column</u>  does  not contain <u>key</u>, the
              record is always omitted from the results.  Thus, the  condition
              <b>other-config:mtu!=1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose
              value is not 1500, but not those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

              For  the  set  operators, when <u>key</u> is specified but a particular
              record's <u>column</u> does not contain <u>key</u>,  the  comparison  is  done
              against   an   empty   set.    Thus,  the  condition  <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:mtu{!=}1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose  value
              is not 1500 and those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

              Don't forget to escape <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> from interpretation by the shell.

              If  <b>--columns</b>  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns are
              listed, in the  specified  order.   Otherwise  all  columns  are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              The  UUIDs  shown for rows created in the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invoca‐
              tion will be wrong.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><u>name</u>] <b>get</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]]...
              Prints the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in
              <u>table</u>.  For map columns, a <u>key</u> may optionally be  specified,  in
              which  case  the  value  associated  with  <u>key</u>  in the column is
              printed, instead of the entire map.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist  or
              <u>key</u>  is  specified,  if  <u>key</u>  does  not  exist  in <u>record</u>.  With
              <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <u>record</u> yields no output and a missing <u>key</u>
              prints a blank line.

              If <b>@</b><u>name</u> is specified, then the UUID for <u>record</u> may be  referred
              to  by  that name later in the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation in con‐
              texts where a UUID is expected.

              Both <b>--id</b> and the <u>column</u> arguments are optional, but usually  at
              least  one  or the other should be specified.  If both are omit‐
              ted, then <b>get</b> has no effect except to verify that <u>record</u>  exists
              in <u>table</u>.

              <b>--id</b> and <b>--if-exists</b> cannot be used together.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Sets  the  value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in
              <u>table</u> to <u>value</u>.  For map columns, a <u>key</u> may optionally be speci‐
              fied, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in that column
              is changed (or added, if none exists),  instead  of  the  entire
              map.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist.
              With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if <u>record</u>  does  not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> [<u>key</u><b>=</b>]<u>value</u>...
              Adds  the  specified value or key-value pair to <u>column</u> in <u>record</u>
              in <u>table</u>.  If <u>column</u> is a map, then <u>key</u> is  required,  otherwise
              it  is  prohibited.  If <u>key</u> already exists in a map column, then
              the current <u>value</u> is not replaced (use the <b>set</b>  command  to  re‐
              place an existing value).

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist.
              With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if <u>record</u>  does  not

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>value</u>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Removes  the  specified values or key-value pairs from <u>column</u> in
              <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>.  The first form applies to columns that are not
              maps: each specified <u>value</u> is removed from the column.  The sec‐
              ond and third forms apply to map columns: if only a <u>key</u> is spec‐
              ified, then any key-value pair with the given  <u>key</u>  is  removed,
              regardless  of its value; if a <u>value</u> is given then a pair is re‐
              moved only if both key and value match.

              It is not an error if the column does not contain the  specified
              key or value or pair.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist.
              With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if <u>record</u>  does  not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>...
              Sets  each  <u>column</u>  in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u> to the empty set or empty
              map, as appropriate.  This command applies only to columns  that
              are allowed to be empty.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist.
              With <b>--if-exists</b>, this command does nothing if <u>record</u>  does  not
              exist.

       [<b>--id=(@</b><u>name</u> | <u>uuid</u>] <b>create</b> <u>table</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Creates  a  new  record  in <u>table</u> and sets the initial values of
              each <u>column</u>.  Columns not explicitly set will receive their  de‐
              fault values.  Outputs the UUID of the new row.

              If  <b>@</b><u>name</u> is specified, then the UUID for the new row may be re‐
              ferred to by that name elsewhere in the same  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  invoca‐
              tion  in contexts where a UUID is expected.  Such references may
              precede or follow the <b>create</b> command.

              If a valid <u>uuid</u> is specified, then it is used as the UUID of the
              new row.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only
                     when they can be reached directly or indirectly from  the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table.   Except  for  records in the <b>QoS</b> or
                     <b>Queue</b> tables, records that are  not  reachable  from  the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table  are  automatically  deleted from the
                     database.  This  deletion  happens  immediately,  without
                     waiting  for additional <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands or other data‐
                     base activity.  Thus, a <b>create</b> command must generally  be
                     accompanied   by  additional  commands  <u>within</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>same</u>
                     <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <u>invocation</u> to add a chain of references to  the
                     newly  created  record  from  the  top-level <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                     record.  The <b>EXAMPLES</b> section gives  some  examples  that
                     show how to do this.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u>...
              Deletes each specified <u>record</u> from <u>table</u>.  Unless <b>--if-exists</b> is
              specified, each <u>record</u>s must exist.

       <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u>
              Deletes all records from the <u>table</u>.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     The <b>destroy</b> command is only useful for records in the <b>QoS</b>
                     or  <b>Queue</b>  tables.  Records in other tables are automati‐
                     cally deleted from the database when they become unreach‐
                     able from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table.  This means that delet‐
                     ing the last reference to  a  record  is  sufficient  for
                     deleting the record itself.  For records in these tables,
                     <b>destroy</b>  is  silently  ignored.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section
                     below for more information.

       <b>wait-until</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
              Waits until <u>table</u> contains a record named  <u>record</u>  whose  <u>column</u>
              equals  <u>value</u>  or,  if <u>key</u> is specified, whose <u>column</u> contains a
              <u>key</u> with the specified <u>value</u>.  This command  supports  the  same
              operators and semantics described for the <b>find</b> command above.

              If no <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u> arguments are given, this command waits
              only  until  <u>record</u>  exists.   If more than one such argument is
              given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Usually <b>wait-until</b> should be placed at the beginning of a
                     set  of  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  commands.   For  example,  <b>wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> waits until a
                     bridge named <b>br0</b> is created, then prints its  <b>datapath_id</b>
                     column,  whereas <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> <b>--</b> <b>wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> will abort if no bridge named <b>br0</b> exists  when
                     <b>ovs-vsctl</b> initially connects to the database.

              Consider specifying <b>--timeout=0</b> along with <b>--wait-until</b>, to pre‐
              vent  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  from  terminating  after waiting only at most 5
              seconds.

       <b>comment</b> [<u>arg</u>]...
              This command has no effect on behavior,  but  any  database  log
              record  created  by the command will include the command and its
              arguments.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Create a new bridge named br0 and add port eth0 to it:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-br</b> <b>br0</b>
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>eth0</b>

       Alternatively, perform both operations in a single atomic transaction:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-br</b> <b>br0</b> <b>--</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>eth0</b>

       Delete bridge <b>br0</b>, reporting an error if it does not exist:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>del-br</b> <b>br0</b>

       Delete bridge <b>br0</b> if it exists:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--if-exists</b> <b>del-br</b> <b>br0</b>

       Set the <b>qos</b> column of the <b>Port</b> record for <b>eth0</b> to point to  a  new  <b>QoS</b>
       record, which in turn points with its queue 0 to a new <b>Queue</b> record:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>qos=@newqos</b> <b>--</b> <b>--id=@newqos</b> <b>create</b>
              <b>qos</b>         <b>type=linux-htb</b>         <b>other-config:max-rate=1000000</b>
              <b>queues:0=@newqueue</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>--id=@newqueue</b>  <b>create</b>  <b>queue</b> <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:min-rate=1000000</b> <b>other-config:max-rate=1000000</b>

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>COOKBOOK</b>
   <b>Port</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       Add an ``internal port'' <b>vlan10</b> to bridge <b>br0</b> as a VLAN access port for
       VLAN 10, and configure it with an IP address:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>vlan10</b> <b>tag=10</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>Interface</b>  <b>vlan10</b>
              <b>type=internal</b>

              <b>ip</b> <b>addr</b> <b>add</b> <b>192.168.0.123/24</b> <b>dev</b> <b>vlan10</b>

       Add a GRE tunnel port <b>gre0</b> to remote IP address 1.2.3.4 to bridge <b>br0</b>:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>add-port</b>  <b>br0</b> <b>gre0</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>gre0</b> <b>type=gre</b> <b>op‐</b>
              <b>tions:remote_ip=1.2.3.4</b>

   <b>Port</b> <b>Mirroring</b>
       Mirror all packets received or sent on <b>eth0</b> or <b>eth1</b> onto <b>eth2</b>, assuming
       that all of those ports exist on bridge  <b>br0</b>  (as  a  side-effect  this
       causes any packets received on <b>eth2</b> to be ignored):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mirrors=@m</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@eth0</b> <b>get</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@eth1</b> <b>get</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@eth2</b> <b>get</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth2</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>    <b>--id=@m</b>    <b>create</b>    <b>Mirror</b>    <b>name=mymirror</b>   <b>select-dst-</b>
              <b>port=@eth0,@eth1</b> <b>select-src-port=@eth0,@eth1</b> <b>output-port=@eth2</b>

       Remove the mirror created above from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the  Mir‐
       ror record (since it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>--id=@rec</b> <b>get</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>mymirror</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>remove</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mirrors</b> <b>@rec</b>

       The following simpler command also works:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mirrors</b>

   <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> <b>(QoS)</b>
       Create a <b>linux-htb</b> QoS record that points to a few queues and use it on
       <b>eth0</b> and <b>eth1</b>:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>qos=@newqos</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>qos=@newqos</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>    <b>--id=@newqos</b>    <b>create</b>   <b>QoS</b>   <b>type=linux-htb</b>   <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:max-rate=1000000000</b> <b>queues=0=@q0,1=@q1</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>   <b>--id=@q0</b>   <b>create</b>   <b>Queue</b>   <b>other-config:min-rate=100000000</b>
              <b>other-config:max-rate=100000000</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@q1</b> <b>create</b> <b>Queue</b> <b>other-config:min-rate=500000000</b>

       Deconfigure the QoS record above from <b>eth1</b> only:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>qos</b>

       To  deconfigure  the QoS record from both <b>eth0</b> and <b>eth1</b> and then delete
       the QoS record (which must be done explicitly because unreferenced  QoS
       records are not automatically destroyed):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>destroy</b>  <b>QoS</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>--</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>qos</b> <b>--</b> <b>clear</b>
              <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>qos</b>

       (This command will leave two unreferenced Queue records  in  the  data‐
       base.   To delete them, use "<b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>list</b> <b>Queue</b>" to find their UUIDs,
       then "<b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>Queue</b> <u>uuid1</u> <u>uuid2</u>" to destroy each of  them  or
       use "<b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>Queue</b>" to delete all records.)

   <b>Connectivity</b> <b>Monitoring</b>
       Monitor connectivity to a remote maintenance point on eth0.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>cfm_mpid=1</b>

       Deconfigure connectivity monitoring from above:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>cfm_mpid</b>

   <b>NetFlow</b>
       Configure  bridge  <b>br0</b> to send NetFlow records to UDP port 5566 on host
       192.168.0.34, with an active timeout of 30 seconds:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>netflow=@nf</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@nf</b>  <b>create</b>  <b>NetFlow</b>  <b>targets=\"192.168.0.34:5566\"</b>  <b>ac‐</b>
              <b>tive-timeout=30</b>

       Update the NetFlow configuration created by the previous command to in‐
       stead use an active timeout of 60 seconds:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>NetFlow</b> <b>br0</b> <b>active_timeout=60</b>

       Deconfigure the NetFlow settings from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the Net‐
       Flow record (since it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>netflow</b>

   <b>sFlow</b>
       Configure  bridge  <b>br0</b> to send sFlow records to a collector on 10.0.0.1
       at port 6343, using <b>eth1</b>'s IP address as the source, with specific sam‐
       pling parameters:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>   <b>--</b>   <b>--id=@s</b>   <b>create</b>    <b>sFlow</b>    <b>agent=eth1</b>    <b>tar‐</b>
              <b>get=\"10.0.0.1:6343\"</b> <b>header=128</b> <b>sampling=64</b> <b>polling=10</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>sflow=@s</b>

       Deconfigure sFlow from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the sFlow record (since
       it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>sflow</b>

   <b>IPFIX</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to send one IPFIX flow record per packet sample to
       UDP  port 4739 on host 192.168.0.34, with Observation Domain ID 123 and
       Observation Point ID 456, a flow cache active timeout of 1  minute  (60
       seconds),  maximum  flow  cache  size of 13 flows, and flows sampled on
       output port with tunnel info(sampling on input and output port  is  en‐
       abled by default if not disabled) :

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>ipfix=@i</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>  <b>--id=@i</b>  <b>create</b>  <b>IPFIX</b> <b>targets=\"192.168.0.34:4739\"</b> <b>obs_do‐</b>

              <b>other_config:enable-input-sampling=false</b>    <b>other_config:enable-</b>
              <b>tunnel-sampling=true</b>

       Deconfigure the IPFIX settings from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the  IPFIX
       record (since it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>ipfix</b>

   <b>802.1D</b> <b>Spanning</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(STP)</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to participate in an 802.1D spanning tree:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>stp_enable=true</b>

       Set the bridge priority of <b>br0</b> to 0x7800:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>other_config:stp-priority=0x7800</b>

       Set the path cost of port <b>eth0</b> to 10:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>other_config:stp-path-cost=10</b>

       Deconfigure STP from above:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>stp_enable=false</b>

   <b>Multicast</b> <b>Snooping</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to enable multicast snooping:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mcast_snooping_enable=true</b>

       Set the multicast snooping aging time <b>br0</b> to 300 seconds:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>   <b>set</b>  <b>Bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-aging-</b>
              <b>time=300</b>

       Set the multicast snooping table size <b>br0</b> to 2048 entries:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>Bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>   <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-table-</b>
              <b>size=2048</b>

       Disable  flooding  of unregistered multicast packets to all ports. When
       set to <b>true</b>, the switch will send unregistered multicast  packets  only
       to  ports  connected to multicast routers. When it is set to <b>false</b>, the
       switch will send them to all ports. This command disables the flood  of
       unregistered packets on bridge <b>br0</b>.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>Bridge</b>  <b>br0</b> <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-disable-</b>
              <b>flood-unregistered=true</b>

       Enable flooding of multicast packets (except  Reports)  on  a  specific
       port.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-flood=true</b>

       Enable flooding of Reports on a specific port.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>Port</b>  <b>eth1</b> <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-flood-re‐</b>
              <b>ports=true</b>

       Deconfigure multicasting snooping from above:

   <b>802.1D-2004</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>Spanning</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(RSTP)</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to participate in an  802.1D-2004  Rapid  Spanning
       Tree:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>rstp_enable=true</b>

              <b>dress=00:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa</b>

       Set the bridge priority of <b>br0</b> to 0x7000. The value must  be  specified
       in  decimal  notation  and  should be a multiple of 4096 (if not, it is
       rounded down to the nearest multiple of  4096).  The  default  priority
