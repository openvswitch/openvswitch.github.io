<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-vsctl - utility for querying and configuring <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  [<u>options</u>]  <b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>args</u>] [<b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u>
       [<u>args</u>]]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  program  configures  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>(8)  by  providing   a
       high-level    interface    to    its   configuration   database.    See
       <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database
       schema.

       <b>ovs-vsctl</b> connects to an <b>ovsdb-server</b> process that  maintains  an  Open
       vSwitch  configuration database.  Using this connection, it queries and
       possibly applies changes to the database,  depending  on  the  supplied
       commands.   Then,  if it applied any changes, by default it waits until
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> has finished reconfiguring itself before  it  exits.   (If
       you use <b>ovs-vsctl</b> when <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is not running, use <b>--no-wait</b>.)

       <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  can  perform  any number of commands in a single run, imple‐
       mented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The <b>ovs-vsctl</b> command line begins with global options (see <b>OPTIONS</b>  be‐
       low  for details).  The global options are followed by one or more com‐
       mands.  Each command should begin with <b>--</b> by itself as  a  command-line
       argument,  to  separate it from the following commands.  (The <b>--</b> before
       the first command is optional.)  The command itself  starts  with  com‐
       mand-specific options, if any, followed by the command name and any ar‐
       guments.  See <b>EXAMPLES</b> below for syntax examples.

   <b>Linux</b> <b>VLAN</b> <b>Bridging</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       The  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  program  supports  the model of a bridge implemented by
       Open vSwitch, in which a  single  bridge  supports  ports  on  multiple
       VLANs.   In  this  model,  each port on a bridge is either a trunk port
       that potentially passes packets tagged with 802.1Q headers that  desig‐
       nate  VLANs  or  it  is  assigned  a single implicit VLAN that is never
       tagged with an 802.1Q header.

       For  compatibility  with  software  designed  for  the  Linux   bridge,
       <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  also  supports  a  model  in which traffic associated with a
       given 802.1Q VLAN is segregated into a separate bridge.  A special form
       of the <b>add-br</b> command (see below) creates a ``fake bridge''  within  an
       Open  vSwitch  bridge  to  simulate  this behavior.  When such a ``fake
       bridge'' is active, <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will treat it much like a bridge separate
       from its ``parent bridge,''  but  the  actual  implementation  in  Open
       vSwitch  uses  only  a single bridge, with ports on the fake bridge as‐
       signed the implicit VLAN of the fake bridge of which they are  members.
       (A fake bridge for VLAN 0 receives packets that have no 802.1Q tag or a
       tag with VLAN 0.)

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       The  following  options affect the behavior <b>ovs-vsctl</b> as a whole.  Some
       individual commands also accept their own options, which are given just
       before the command name.  If the first command on the command line  has
       options,  then  those options must be separated from the global options
       by <b>--</b>.

       <b>--db=</b><u>server</u>
              Sets <u>server</u> as the database server that  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  contacts  to
              query or modify configuration.  <u>server</u> may be an OVSDB active or
              passive  connection  method,  as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  The de‐
              fault is <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Prevents <b>ovs-vsctl</b> from waiting for <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to  reconfigure
              itself  according  to the modified database.  This option should
              be used if <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is  not  running;  otherwise,  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
              will not exit until <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> starts.

              This  option  has  no  effect  if  the commands specified do not
              change the database.

       <b>--no-syslog</b>
              By default, <b>ovs-vsctl</b> logs its arguments and the details of  any
              changes  that  it makes to the system log.  This option disables
              this logging.

              This option is equivalent to <b>--verbose=vsctl:syslog:warn</b>.

       <b>--oneline</b>
              Modifies the output format so that the output for  each  command
              is  printed  on  a  single line.  New-line characters that would
              otherwise separate lines are printed as <b>\n</b>, and any instances of
              <b>\</b> that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.  Prints
              a blank line for each command that has no output.   This  option
              does  not  affect the formatting of output from the <b>list</b> or <b>find</b>
              commands; see <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> below.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Prevents <b>ovs-vsctl</b> from actually modifying the database.

       <b>-t</b> <u>secs</u>
       <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              By default, or with a <u>secs</u> of <b>0</b>, <b>ovs-vsctl</b> waits forever  for  a
              response  from  the database.  This option limits runtime to ap‐
              proximately <u>secs</u> seconds.  If  the  timeout  expires,  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
              will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal.  (A timeout would normally hap‐
              pen  only  if the database cannot be contacted, or if the system
              is overloaded.)

       <b>--retry</b>
              Without this option, if <b>ovs-vsctl</b> connects outward to the  data‐
              base  server  (the  default)  then <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will try to connect
              once and exit with an error if the connection fails (which  usu‐
              ally means that <b>ovsdb-server</b> is not running).

              With  this  option,  or  if <b>--db</b> specifies that <b>ovs-vsctl</b> should
              listen for an incoming connection from the database server, then
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will wait for a connection to the database forever.

              Regardless of this setting, <b>--timeout</b>  always  limits  how  long
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will wait.

   <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b>
       These  options control the format of output from the <b>list</b> and <b>find</b> com‐
       mands.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
              Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of  <u>for‐</u>
              <u>mat</u> are available:

              <b>table</b>  2-D text tables with aligned columns.

              <b>list</b> (default)
                     A  list  with one column per line and rows separated by a
                     blank line.

              <b>html</b>   HTML tables.

              <b>csv</b>    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

              <b>json</b>   JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a  se‐
                     quence  of JSON objects, each of which corresponds to one
                     table.  Each JSON object has the following  members  with
                     the noted values:

                     <b>caption</b>
                            The  table's  caption.   This member is omitted if
                            the table has no caption.

                     <b>headings</b>
                            An array with one element per table column.   Each
                            array element is a string giving the corresponding
                            column's heading.

                     <b>data</b>   An array with one element per table row.  Each el‐
                            ement  is also an array with one element per table
                            column.  The elements of this  second-level  array
                            are  the  cells  that constitute the table.  Cells
                            that represent OVSDB data or data  types  are  ex‐
                            pressed in the format described in the OVSDB spec‐
                            ification;  other  cells  are  simply expressed as
                            text strings.

       <b>-d</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--data=</b><u>format</u>
              Sets the formatting for cells within output  tables  unless  the
              table  format  is  set to <b>json</b>, in which case <b>json</b> formatting is
              always used when formatting cells.  The following types of  <u>for‐</u>
              <u>mat</u> are available:

              <b>string</b> (default)
                     The  simple  format described in the <b>Database</b> <b>Values</b> sec‐
                     tion below.

              <b>bare</b>   The simple format with punctuation stripped off:  <b>[]</b>  and
                     <b>{}</b>  are  omitted  around  sets,  maps, and empty columns,
                     items within  sets  and  maps  are  space-separated,  and
                     strings  are never quoted.  This format may be easier for
                     scripts to parse.

              <b>json</b>   The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

       <b>--no-headings</b>
              This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in
              the first row of table output.

       <b>--pretty</b>
              By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as  possible.
              This  option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more read‐
              able fashion.  Members of objects and  elements  of  arrays  are
              printed one per line, with indentation.

              This  option  does  not  affect  JSON in tables, which is always
              printed compactly.

       <b>--bare</b> Equivalent to <b>--format=list</b> <b>--data=bare</b> <b>--no-headings</b>.

       <b>--max-column-width=</b><u>n</u>
              For table output only, limits the width of  any  column  in  the
              output  to  <u>n</u> columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to fit, as
              necessary.  Columns are always wide enough to display the column
              names, if the heading row is printed.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented to it by
              SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers use
              to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or  <b>--certificate</b>,  or
              it may be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates presented by SSL peers.
              This introduces a security risk, because it means that  certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              When <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>ovs-vsctl</b> will attempt to
              obtain  the  CA  certificate  from the SSL peer on its first SSL
              connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is success‐
              ful, it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect,  and
              from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a cer‐
              tificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              <b>This</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>exposes</b>  <b>the</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>man-in-the-middle</b>
              <b>attack</b> <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be  use‐
              ful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certifi‐
              cate  as  part  of  the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol
              does not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should be the
              CA certificate used to sign <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s  own  certificate,  that
              is,  the  certificate  specified  on  <b>-c</b>  or  <b>--certificate</b>.  If
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s certificate is self-signed, then  <b>--certificate</b>  and
              <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This  option  is not useful in normal operation, because the SSL
              peer must already have the CA certificate for the peer  to  have
              any  confidence in <b>ovs-vsctl</b>'s identity.  However, this offers a
              way for a new installation to bootstrap the  CA  certificate  on
              its first SSL connection.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.   (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,   <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
                     closes  its  standard file descriptors, so logging to the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name   used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is  <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-vsctl.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution needs to be taken into account, for ex‐
                     ample, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen  on
                     the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could
                     be interfering with local syslog traffic  and  there  are
                     some  security  considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>COMMANDS</b>
       The commands implemented by <b>ovs-vsctl</b> are described in the sections be‐
       low.

   <b>Open</b> <b>vSwitch</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands work with an Open vSwitch as a whole.

       <b>init</b>   Initializes  the  Open vSwitch database, if it is empty.  If the
              database has already been initialized, this command has  no  ef‐
              fect.

              Any  successful  <b>ovs-vsctl</b> command automatically initializes the
              Open vSwitch database if it is empty.  This command is  provided
              to initialize the database without executing any other command.

       <b>show</b>   Prints a brief overview of the database contents.

       <b>emer-reset</b>
              Reset  the  configuration  into  a clean state.  It deconfigures
              OpenFlow controllers, OVSDB servers, and SSL, and  deletes  port
              mirroring,  <b>fail_mode</b>,  NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX configuration.
              This command also removes all <b>other-config</b> keys from  all  data‐
              base records, except that <b>other-config:hwaddr</b> is preserved if it
              is  present  in a Bridge record.  Other networking configuration
              is left as-is.

   <b>Bridge</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch bridges.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-br</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Creates a new bridge named <u>bridge</u>.  Initially  the  bridge  will
              have no ports (other than <u>bridge</u> itself).

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>,  attempting to create a bridge that exists
              is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this  command  does  nothing  if
              <u>bridge</u> already exists as a real bridge.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-br</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>parent</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Creates  a ``fake bridge'' named <u>bridge</u> within the existing Open
              vSwitch bridge <u>parent</u>, which must already exist and must not it‐
              self be a fake bridge.  The new fake bridge will  be  on  802.1Q
              VLAN  <u>vlan</u>,  which  must  be an integer between 0 and 4095.  The
              parent bridge must not already have  a  fake  bridge  for  <u>vlan</u>.
              Initially <u>bridge</u> will have no ports (other than <u>bridge</u> itself).

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>,  attempting to create a bridge that exists
              is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this  command  does  nothing  if
              <u>bridge</u> already exists as a VLAN bridge under <u>parent</u> for <u>vlan</u>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-br</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Deletes  <u>bridge</u>  and  all  of  its  ports.   If <u>bridge</u> is a real
              bridge, this command also deletes any  fake  bridges  that  were
              created with <u>bridge</u> as parent, including all of their ports.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a bridge that does not
              exist  is  an  error.   With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a
              bridge that does not exist has no effect.

       [<b>--real</b>|<b>--fake</b>] <b>list-br</b>
              Lists all existing real and fake bridges on standard output, one
              per line.  With <b>--real</b> or <b>--fake</b>, only bridges of that type  are
              returned.

       <b>br-exists</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Tests  whether  <u>bridge</u>  exists as a real or fake bridge.  If so,
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  exits  successfully  with  exit  code  0.   If   not,
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> exits unsuccessfully with exit code 2.

       <b>br-to-vlan</b> <u>bridge</u>
              If <u>bridge</u> is a fake bridge, prints the bridge's 802.1Q VLAN as a
              decimal integer.  If <u>bridge</u> is a real bridge, prints 0.

       <b>br-to-parent</b> <u>bridge</u>
              If  <u>bridge</u>  is  a  fake  bridge,  prints  the name of its parent
              bridge.  If <u>bridge</u> is a real bridge, print <u>bridge</u>.

       <b>br-set-external-id</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>key</u> [<u>value</u>]
              Sets or clears an ``external ID'' value on <u>bridge</u>.  These values
              are intended to identify entities external to Open vSwitch  with
              which  <u>bridge</u>  is  associated, e.g. the bridge's identifier in a
              virtualization management platform.  The Open  vSwitch  database
              schema  specifies  well-known  <u>key</u> values, but <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> are
              otherwise arbitrary strings.

              If <u>value</u> is specified, then <u>key</u> is  set  to  <u>value</u>  for  <u>bridge</u>,
              overwriting  any  previous value.  If <u>value</u> is omitted, then <u>key</u>
              is removed  from  <u>bridge</u>'s  set  of  external  IDs  (if  it  was
              present).

              For  real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to that
              of a <b>set</b> or <b>remove</b> command in the  <b>external-ids</b>  column  of  the
              <b>Bridge</b>  table.  For fake bridges, it actually modifies keys with
              names prefixed by <b>fake-bridge-</b> in the <b>Port</b> table.

       <b>br-get-external-id</b> <u>bridge</u> [<u>key</u>]
              Queries the external IDs on <u>bridge</u>.  If <u>key</u>  is  specified,  the
              output  is  the value for that <u>key</u> or the empty string if <u>key</u> is
              unset.  If <u>key</u> is omitted, the  output  is  <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>,  one  per
              line, for each key-value pair.

              For  real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to that
              of a <b>get</b> command in the <b>external-ids</b> column of the <b>Bridge</b> table.
              For fake  bridges,  it  queries  keys  with  names  prefixed  by
              <b>fake-bridge-</b> in the <b>Port</b> table.

   <b>Port</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These  commands  examine and manipulate Open vSwitch ports.  These com‐
       mands treat a bonded port as a single entity.

       <b>list-ports</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists all of the ports within <u>bridge</u> on standard output, one per
              line.  The local port <u>bridge</u> is not included in the list.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-port</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>port</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]=<u>value</u>]...
              Creates on <u>bridge</u> a new port named <u>port</u> from the network  device
              of the same name.

              Optional  arguments set values of column in the Port record cre‐
              ated by the command.  For example, <b>tag=9</b> would make the port  an
              access  port for VLAN 9.  The syntax is the same as that for the
              <b>set</b> command (see <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b> below).

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a port that exists  is
              an  error.   With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if <u>port</u>
              already exists on <u>bridge</u> and is not a bonded port.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-port</b> [<u>bridge</u>] <u>port</u>
              Deletes <u>port</u>.  If <u>bridge</u> is omitted, <u>port</u> is removed from  what‐
              ever  bridge contains it; if <u>bridge</u> is specified, it must be the
              real or fake bridge that contains <u>port</u>.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a port that  does  not
              exist  is  an  error.   With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a
              port that does not exist has no effect.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>--with-iface</b> <b>del-port</b> [<u>bridge</u>] <u>iface</u>
              Deletes the port named <u>iface</u> or  that  has  an  interface  named
              <u>iface</u>.   If <u>bridge</u> is omitted, the port is removed from whatever
              bridge contains it; if <u>bridge</u> is specified, it must be the  real
              or fake bridge that contains the port.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete the port for an inter‐
              face  that  does  not  exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, at‐
              tempting to delete the port for an interface that does not exist
              has no effect.

       <b>port-to-br</b> <u>port</u>
              Prints the name of the bridge that  contains  <u>port</u>  on  standard
              output.

   <b>Bond</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands work with ports that have more than one interface, which
       Open vSwitch calls ``bonds.''

       [<b>--fake-iface</b>] <b>add-bond</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>port</u> <u>iface</u>... [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]=<u>value</u>]...
              Creates  on <u>bridge</u> a new port named <u>port</u> that bonds together the
              network devices given as each <u>iface</u>.  At  least  two  interfaces
              must  be  named.   If  the  interfaces are DPDK enabled then the
              transaction will need to include operations  to  explicitly  set
              the interface type to 'dpdk'.

              Optional  arguments set values of column in the Port record cre‐
              ated by the command.  The syntax is the same as that for the <b>set</b>
              command (see <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b> below).

              With <b>--fake-iface</b>, a fake interface with the name <u>port</u>  is  cre‐
              ated.   This  should  only be used for compatibility with legacy
              software that requires it.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to create a port that exists  is
              an  error.   With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if <u>port</u>
              already exists on <u>bridge</u> and bonds together exactly  the  speci‐
              fied interfaces.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-bond-iface</b> <u>bond</u> <u>iface</u>
              Adds  <u>iface</u>  as  a new bond interface to the existing port <u>bond</u>.
              If <u>bond</u> previously had only one port, this transforms it into  a
              bond.

              Without  <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to add an <u>iface</u> that is already
              part of <u>bond</u> is an error.  With <b>--may-exist</b>, this  command  does
              nothing if <u>iface</u> is already part of <u>bond</u>.  (It is still an error
              if <u>iface</u> is an interface of some other port or bond.)

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-bond-iface</b> [<u>bond</u>] <u>iface</u>
              Removes  <u>iface</u>  from its port.  If <u>bond</u> is omitted, <u>iface</u> is re‐
              moved from whatever port contains it; if <u>bond</u> is  specified,  it
              must be the port that contains <u>bond</u>.

              If  removing  <u>iface</u> causes its port to have only a single inter‐
              face, then that port transforms from a  bond  into  an  ordinary
              port.   It  is  an  error  if <u>iface</u> is the only interface in its
              port.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete an interface that does
              not exist is an error.  With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting  to  delete
              an interface that does not exist has no effect.

   <b>Interface</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These  commands  examine  the  interfaces  attached  to an Open vSwitch
       bridge.  These commands treat a bonded port as a collection of  two  or
       more interfaces, rather than as a single port.

       <b>list-ifaces</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists  all  of  the interfaces within <u>bridge</u> on standard output,
              one per line.  The local port <u>bridge</u>  is  not  included  in  the
              list.

       <b>iface-to-br</b> <u>iface</u>
              Prints  the  name  of the bridge that contains <u>iface</u> on standard
              output.

   <b>Conntrack</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and modify datapath CT zones, Timeout Policies and
       Limits.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>add-zone-tp</b> <u>datapath</u> <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> <u>policies</u>
              Creates a conntrack zone timeout policy with  <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>  in  <u>data‐</u>
              <u>path</u>.   The  <u>policies</u>  consist  of <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> pairs, separated by
              spaces.  For example, <b>icmp_first=30</b>  <b>icmp_reply=60</b>  specifies  a
              30-second timeout policy for the first ICMP packet and a 60-sec‐
              ond  policy  for  ICMP reply packets.  See the <b>CT_Timeout_Policy</b>
              table in <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) for the supported keys.

              Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to add a <u>policy</u> for <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> that
              already has a policy is an error.
               With <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if policy for
               <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> already exists.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-zone-tp</b> <u>datapath</u> <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>
              Delete the timeout policy associated with <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> from <u>datapath</u>.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a policy for zone that
              does not exist or doesn't have  a  policy  is  an  error.   With
              <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a a policy that does not exist
              has no effect.

       <b>list-zone-tp</b> <u>datapath</u>
              Prints the timeout policies of all zones in <u>datapath</u>.

       <b>set-zone-limit</b> <u>datapath</u> <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>|<b>default</b> <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u>
              Sets  a  conntrack  zone limit with <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>|<u>default</u> in <u>datapath</u>.
              The <u>limit</u> with value <b>0</b> means unlimited.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>del-zone-limit</b> <u>datapath</u> <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u>|<b>default</b>
              Delete the limit associated with <u>zone</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> from <u>datapath</u>.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a limit for zone  that
              does  not  exist  or  doesn't  have  a  limit is an error.  With
              <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to delete a limit that  does  not  exist
              has no effect.

       <b>list-zone-limits</b> <u>datapath</u>
              Prints the limits of all zones in <u>datapath</u>.

   <b>Datapath</b> <b>Capabilities</b> <b>Command</b>
       The command query datapath capabilities.

       <b>list-dp-cap</b> <u>datapath</u>
              Prints the datapath's capabilities.

   <b>OpenFlow</b> <b>Controller</b> <b>Connectivity</b>
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> can perform all configured bridging and switching locally,
       or  it can be configured to communicate with one or more external Open‐
       Flow controllers.  The switch is typically configured to connect  to  a
       primary  controller that takes charge of the bridge's flow table to im‐
       plement a network policy.  In addition, the switch can be configured to
       listen to connections from service  controllers.   Service  controllers
       are  typically  used  for occasional support and maintenance, e.g. with
       <b>ovs-ofctl</b>.

       <b>get-controller</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Prints the configured controller target.

       <b>del-controller</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Deletes the configured controller target.

       <b>set-controller</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>target</u>...
              Sets the configured controller target or targets.   Each  <u>target</u>
              may use any of the following forms:

              <b>ssl:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
              <b>tcp:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The  specified  <u>port</u>  on the given <u>host</u>, which can be ex‐
                     pressed either as a DNS name (if built with  unbound  li‐
                     brary)  or  an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6 address format.
                     Wrap   IPv6   addresses   in   square   brackets,    e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.   On  Linux,  use  <b>%</b><u>device</u> to designate a
                     scope    for    IPv6    link-level    addresses,     e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653</b>.   For <b>ssl</b>, the <b>--private-key</b>,
                     <b>--certificate</b>, and <b>--ca-cert</b> options are mandatory.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named <u>file</u>.

                     On Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is  repre‐
                     sented  by  a  file created in the path <u>file</u> to mimic the
                     behavior of a Unix domain socket.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
              <b>ptcp:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens for OpenFlow connections on  <u>port</u>.   The  default
                     <u>port</u>  is  6653.  By default, connections are allowed from
                     any IPv4 address.  Specify <u>host</u> as an IPv4 address  or  a
                     bracketed IPv6 address (e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>).  On Linux,
                     use  <b>%</b><u>device</u> to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level ad‐
                     dresses, e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]</b>.  DNS names can
                     be used if built with unbound  library.   For  <b>pssl</b>,  the
                     <b>--private-key</b>,<b>--certificate</b>,  and  <b>--ca-cert</b>  options are
                     mandatory.

              <b>punix:</b><u>file</u>
                     Listens for  OpenFlow  connections  on  the  Unix  domain
                     server socket named <u>file</u>.

     <u>Controller</u> <u>Failure</u> <u>Settings</u>

       When  a  controller  is  configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible for
       setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if  the  connection  to  the
       controller  fails,  no  new  network connections can be set up.  If the
       connection to the controller stays down long  enough,  no  packets  can
       pass through the switch at all.

       If  the  value  is  <b>standalone</b>, or if neither of these settings is set,
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will take over responsibility for setting up flows when no
       message has been received from the controller for three times the inac‐
       tivity probe interval.  In this mode, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> causes the  datapath
       to  act  like  an ordinary MAC-learning switch.  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will con‐
       tinue to retry connecting to the controller in the background and, when
       the connection succeeds, it discontinues its standalone behavior.

       If this option is set to <b>secure</b>, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will not set up flows  on
       its own when the controller connection fails.

       <b>get-fail-mode</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Prints the configured failure mode.

       <b>del-fail-mode</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Deletes the configured failure mode.

       <b>set-fail-mode</b> <u>bridge</u> <b>standalone</b>|<b>secure</b>
              Sets the configured failure mode.

   <b>Manager</b> <b>Connectivity</b>
       These   commands   manipulate   the   <b>manager_options</b>   column  in  the
       <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table and rows in the <b>Managers</b> table.   When  <b>ovsdb-server</b>
       is  configured  to use the <b>manager_options</b> column for OVSDB connections
       (as described in the startup scripts provided with  Open  vSwitch;  the
       corresponding      <b>ovsdb-server</b>     command     option     is     <b>--re‐</b>
       <b>mote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options</b>), this allows the ad‐
       ministrator to use <b>ovs-vsctl</b> to configure database connections.

       <b>get-manager</b>
              Prints the configured manager(s).

       <b>del-manager</b>
              Deletes the configured manager(s).

       <b>set-manager</b> <u>target</u>...
              Sets the configured manager target or targets.  Each <u>target</u>  may
              be an OVSDB active or passive connection method, e.g. <b>pssl:6640</b>,
              as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

   <b>SSL</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       When  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  is configured to connect over SSL for management or
       controller connectivity, the following parameters are required:

       <u>private-key</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as the vir‐
              tual switch's identity for SSL connections to the controller.

       <u>certificate</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a  certificate,  signed  by  the
              certificate  authority  (CA) used by the controller and manager,
              that certifies the virtual switch's private key,  identifying  a
              trustworthy switch.

       <u>ca-cert</u>
              Specifies  a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to ver‐
              ify that the virtual switch is connected to a  trustworthy  con‐
              troller.

       These files are read only once, at <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> startup time.  If their
       contents change, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> must be killed and restarted.

       These  SSL  settings  apply  to all SSL connections made by the virtual
       switch.

       <b>get-ssl</b>
              Prints the SSL configuration.

       <b>del-ssl</b>
              Deletes the current SSL configuration.

       [<b>--bootstrap</b>] <b>set-ssl</b> <u>private-key</u> <u>certificate</u> <u>ca-cert</u>
              Sets the SSL configuration.  The <b>--bootstrap</b> option is described
              below.

     <u>CA</u> <u>Certificate</u> <u>Bootstrap</u>

       Ordinarily, all of the files named in the SSL configuration must  exist
       when  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> starts.  However, if the <u>ca-cert</u> file does not exist
       and the <b>--bootstrap</b> option is given, then <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will attempt  to
       obtain  the CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL connec‐
       tion and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is successful,  it  will
       immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL
       connections  must  be  authenticated  by a certificate signed by the CA
       certificate thus obtained.

       <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>man-in-the-middle</b>  <b>attack</b>
       <b>obtaining</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>initial</b>  <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be useful for boot‐
       strapping.

       This option is only useful if the controller sends its  CA  certificate
       as  part  of  the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol does not re‐
       quire the controller to send the CA certificate.

   <b>Auto-Attach</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard describes a compact method  of
       using IEEE 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a
       IEEE  802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically at‐
       tach network devices to individual services in a SPB network.  The  in‐
       tent  here is to allow network applications and devices using OVS to be
       able to easily take advantage of features offered by industry  standard
       SPB  networks.  A  fundamental element of the Auto-Attach feature is to
       map traditional VLANs onto SPB I_SIDs. These commands manage the  Auto-
       Attach I-SID/VLAN mappings.

       <b>add-aa-mapping</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>i-sid</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Creates a new Auto-Attach mapping on <u>bridge</u> for <u>i-sid</u> and <u>vlan</u>.

       <b>del-aa-mapping</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>i-sid</u> <u>vlan</u>
              Deletes an Auto-Attach mapping on <u>bridge</u> for <u>i-sid</u> and <u>vlan</u>.

       <b>get-aa-mapping</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists  all of the Auto-Attach mappings within <u>bridge</u> on standard
              output.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb</b> tables.  They are
       a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb</b> interface and as such they operate at
       a lower level than other <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands.

     <u>Identifying</u> <u>Tables,</u> <u>Records,</u> <u>and</u> <u>Columns</u>

       Each of these commands has a <u>table</u> parameter to identify a table within
       the database.  Many of them also take a <u>record</u> parameter  that  identi‐
       fies  a  particular record within a table.  The <u>record</u> parameter may be
       the UUID for a record, and many tables offer additional ways  to  iden‐
       tify  records.  Some commands also take <u>column</u> parameters that identify
       a particular field within the records in a table.

       For a list of tables and their columns, see <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5)  or
       see the table listing from the <b>--help</b> option.

       Record names must be specified in full and with correct capitalization,
       except  that  UUIDs  may  be abbreviated to their first 4 (or more) hex
       digits, as long as that is unique within the table.   Names  of  tables
       and  columns  are  not  case-sensitive,  and <b>-</b> and <b>_</b> are treated inter‐
       changeably.  Unique abbreviations of table and column names are accept‐
       able, e.g. <b>net</b> or <b>n</b> is sufficient to identify the <b>NetFlow</b> table.

     <u>Database</u> <u>Values</u>

       Each column in the database accepts a fixed type  of  data.   The  cur‐
       rently defined basic types, and their representations, are:

       integer
              A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1, inclusive.

       real   A floating-point number.

       Boolean
              True or false, written <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, respectively.

       string An  arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are not al‐
              lowed.  Quotes are optional for most strings that begin with  an
              English letter or underscore and consist only of letters, under‐
              scores,  hyphens,  and  periods.   However,  <b>true</b>  and <b>false</b> and
              strings that match the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must  be  en‐
              closed  in  double  quotes  to distinguish them from other basic
              types.  When double quotes are  used,  the  syntax  is  that  of
              strings  in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to escape special
              characters.  The empty string must be represented as a  pair  of
              double quotes (<b>""</b>).

       UUID   Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122,
              e.g.  <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>,  or an <b>@</b><u>name</u> defined
              by a <b>get</b> or <b>create</b> command within the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a sin‐
       gle comma.  When multiple values are present, duplicates  are  not  al‐
       lowed,  and  order is not important.  Conversely, some database columns
       can have an empty set of values, represented as <b>[]</b>, and square brackets
       may optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single values  as  well.
       For  a  column  accepting a set of integers, database commands accept a
       range. A range is represented by two integers separated by <b>-</b>.  A  range
       is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of 4096 elements. If more ele‐
       ments are needed, they can be specified in separate ranges.

       A  few  database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where the key
       and the value are each some fixed database type.  These  are  specified
       in  the  form  <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, where <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> follow the syntax for the
       column's key type and value type, respectively.   When  multiple  pairs
       are  present  (separated  by spaces or a comma), duplicate keys are not
       allowed, and again the order is not important.   Duplicate  values  are
       allowed.   An empty map is represented as <b>{}</b>.  Curly braces may option‐
       ally enclose non-empty maps as well (but  use  quotes  to  prevent  the
       shell   from  expanding  <b>other-config={0=x,1=y}</b>  into  <b>other-config=0=x</b>
       <b>other-config=1=y</b>, which may not have the desired effect).

     <u>Database</u> <u>Command</u> <u>Syntax</u>

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>list</b> <u>table</u> [<u>record</u>]...
              Lists the data in each specified  <u>record</u>.   If  no  records  are
              specified, lists all the records in <u>table</u>.

              If  <b>--columns</b>  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns are
              listed, in the specified  order.   Otherwise,  all  columns  are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if any specified <u>record</u> does
              not  exist.   With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  the command ignores any <u>record</u>
              that does not exist, without producing any output.

       [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>find</b> <u>table</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
              Lists the data in each record in <u>table</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u>
              or, if <u>key</u> is specified, whose <u>column</u> contains a  <u>key</u>  with  the
              specified <u>value</u>.  The following operators may be used where <b>=</b> is
              written in the syntax summary:

              <b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>
                     Selects  records  in  which <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] equals, does not
                     equal, is less than, is greater than,  is  less  than  or
                     equal  to,  or is greater than or equal to <u>value</u>, respec‐
                     tively.

                     Consider <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] and  <u>value</u>  as  sets  of  elements.
                     Identical  sets  are considered equal.  Otherwise, if the
                     sets have different numbers of  elements,  then  the  set
                     with  more  elements  is considered to be larger.  Other‐
                     wise, consider a element from each set pairwise,  in  in‐
                     creasing order within each set.  The first pair that dif‐
                     fers  determines the result.  (For a column that contains
                     key-value pairs, first all the  keys  are  compared,  and
                     values  are considered only if the two sets contain iden‐
                     tical keys.)

              <b>{=}</b> <b>{!=}</b>
                     Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

              <b>{&lt;=}</b>   Selects records in which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is  a  subset  of
                     <u>value</u>.   For  example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2</b> selects records
                     in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty set or  con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 or both.

              <b>{&lt;}</b>    Selects  records in which <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is a proper subset
                     of <u>value</u>.  For example, <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2</b> selects records
                     in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty set or  con‐
                     tains 1 or 2 but not both.

              <b>{&gt;=}</b> <b>{&gt;}</b>
                     Same as <b>{&lt;=}</b> and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except that the rela‐
                     tionship  is  reversed.   For example, <b>flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2</b>
                     selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column  contains
                     both 1 and 2.

              The  following operators are available only in Open vSwitch 2.16
              and later:

              <b>{in}</b>   Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is
                     also in <u>value</u>.  (This is the same as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

              <b>{not-in}</b>
                     Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is
                     not in <u>value</u>.

              For arithmetic operators (<b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>), when <u>key</u> is specified
              but a particular record's  <u>column</u>  does  not  contain  <u>key</u>,  the
              record  is always omitted from the results.  Thus, the condition
              <b>other-config:mtu!=1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose
              value is not 1500, but not those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

              For the set operators, when <u>key</u> is specified  but  a  particular
              record's  <u>column</u>  does  not  contain <u>key</u>, the comparison is done
              against  an  empty  set.    Thus,   the   condition   <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:mtu{!=}1500</b>  matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose value
              is not 1500 and those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

              Don't forget to escape <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> from interpretation by the shell.

              If <b>--columns</b>  is  specified,  only  the  requested  columns  are
              listed,  in  the  specified  order.   Otherwise  all columns are
              listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

              The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  invoca‐
              tion will be wrong.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><u>name</u>] <b>get</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]]...
              Prints the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in
              <u>table</u>.   For  map columns, a <u>key</u> may optionally be specified, in
              which case the value  associated  with  <u>key</u>  in  the  column  is
              printed, instead of the entire map.

              Without  <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist or
              <u>key</u> is specified,  if  <u>key</u>  does  not  exist  in  <u>record</u>.   With
              <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <u>record</u> yields no output and a missing <u>key</u>
              prints a blank line.

              If  <b>@</b><u>name</u> is specified, then the UUID for <u>record</u> may be referred
              to by that name later in the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation  in  con‐
              texts where a UUID is expected.

              Both  <b>--id</b> and the <u>column</u> arguments are optional, but usually at
              least one or the other should be specified.  If both  are  omit‐
              ted,  then <b>get</b> has no effect except to verify that <u>record</u> exists
              in <u>table</u>.

              <b>--id</b> and <b>--if-exists</b> cannot be used together.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Sets the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given  <u>record</u>  in
              <u>table</u> to <u>value</u>.  For map columns, a <u>key</u> may optionally be speci‐
              fied, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in that column
              is  changed  (or  added,  if none exists), instead of the entire
              map.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> [<u>key</u><b>=</b>]<u>value</u>...
              Adds the specified value or key-value pair to <u>column</u>  in  <u>record</u>
              in  <u>table</u>.   If <u>column</u> is a map, then <u>key</u> is required, otherwise
              it is prohibited.  If <u>key</u> already exists in a map  column,  then
              the  current  <u>value</u>  is not replaced (use the <b>set</b> command to re‐
              place an existing value).

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>value</u>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u>...
       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from  <u>column</u>  in
              <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>.  The first form applies to columns that are not
              maps: each specified <u>value</u> is removed from the column.  The sec‐
              ond and third forms apply to map columns: if only a <u>key</u> is spec‐
              ified,  then  any  key-value pair with the given <u>key</u> is removed,
              regardless of its value; if a <u>value</u> is given then a pair is  re‐
              moved only if both key and value match.

              It  is not an error if the column does not contain the specified
              key or value or pair.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>...
              Sets each <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u> to the empty  set  or  empty
              map,  as appropriate.  This command applies only to columns that
              are allowed to be empty.

              Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.
              With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not
              exist.

       [<b>--id=(@</b><u>name</u> | <u>uuid</u>] <b>create</b> <u>table</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Creates a new record in <u>table</u> and sets  the  initial  values  of
              each  <u>column</u>.  Columns not explicitly set will receive their de‐
              fault values.  Outputs the UUID of the new row.

              If <b>@</b><u>name</u> is specified, then the UUID for the new row may be  re‐
              ferred  to  by that name elsewhere in the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invoca‐
              tion in contexts where a UUID is expected.  Such references  may
              precede or follow the <b>create</b> command.

              If a valid <u>uuid</u> is specified, then it is used as the UUID of the
              new row.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only
                     when  they can be reached directly or indirectly from the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table.  Except for records  in  the  <b>QoS</b>  or
                     <b>Queue</b>  tables,  records  that  are not reachable from the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table are  automatically  deleted  from  the
                     database.   This  deletion  happens  immediately, without
                     waiting for additional <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands or other  data‐
                     base  activity.  Thus, a <b>create</b> command must generally be
                     accompanied  by  additional  commands  <u>within</u>  <u>the</u>   <u>same</u>
                     <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <u>invocation</u> to add a chain of references to the
                     newly created  record  from  the  top-level  <b>Open_vSwitch</b>
                     record.   The  <b>EXAMPLES</b>  section gives some examples that
                     show how to do this.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u>...
              Deletes each specified <u>record</u> from <u>table</u>.  Unless <b>--if-exists</b> is
              specified, each <u>record</u>s must exist.

       <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u>
              Deletes all records from the <u>table</u>.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     The <b>destroy</b> command is only useful for records in the <b>QoS</b>
                     or <b>Queue</b> tables.  Records in other tables  are  automati‐
                     cally deleted from the database when they become unreach‐
                     able from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table.  This means that delet‐
                     ing  the  last  reference  to  a record is sufficient for
                     deleting the record itself.  For records in these tables,
                     <b>destroy</b> is silently ignored.  See  the  <b>EXAMPLES</b>  section
                     below for more information.

       <b>wait-until</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
              Waits  until  <u>table</u>  contains a record named <u>record</u> whose <u>column</u>
              equals <u>value</u> or, if <u>key</u> is specified, whose  <u>column</u>  contains  a
              <u>key</u>  with  the  specified <u>value</u>.  This command supports the same
              operators and semantics described for the <b>find</b> command above.

              If no <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u> arguments are given, this command waits
              only until <u>record</u> exists.  If more than  one  such  argument  is
              given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied.

              Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                     Usually <b>wait-until</b> should be placed at the beginning of a
                     set  of  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  commands.   For  example,  <b>wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>--</b> <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b>  waits  until  a
                     bridge  named <b>br0</b> is created, then prints its <b>datapath_id</b>
                     column, whereas <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> <b>--</b>  <b>wait-until</b>
                     <b>bridge</b>  <b>br0</b> will abort if no bridge named <b>br0</b> exists when
                     <b>ovs-vsctl</b> initially connects to the database.

              Consider specifying <b>--timeout=0</b> along with <b>--wait-until</b>, to pre‐
              vent <b>ovs-vsctl</b> from terminating after waiting  only  at  most  5
              seconds.

       <b>comment</b> [<u>arg</u>]...
              This  command  has  no  effect on behavior, but any database log
              record created by the command will include the command  and  its
              arguments.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Create a new bridge named br0 and add port eth0 to it:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-br</b> <b>br0</b>
              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>eth0</b>

       Alternatively, perform both operations in a single atomic transaction:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-br</b> <b>br0</b> <b>--</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>eth0</b>

       Delete bridge <b>br0</b>, reporting an error if it does not exist:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>del-br</b> <b>br0</b>

       Delete bridge <b>br0</b> if it exists:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--if-exists</b> <b>del-br</b> <b>br0</b>

       Set  the  <b>qos</b>  column of the <b>Port</b> record for <b>eth0</b> to point to a new <b>QoS</b>
       record, which in turn points with its queue 0 to a new <b>Queue</b> record:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>qos=@newqos</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>--id=@newqos</b>  <b>create</b>
              <b>qos</b>         <b>type=linux-htb</b>         <b>other-config:max-rate=1000000</b>
              <b>queues:0=@newqueue</b> <b>--</b>  <b>--id=@newqueue</b>  <b>create</b>  <b>queue</b>  <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:min-rate=1000000</b> <b>other-config:max-rate=1000000</b>

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>COOKBOOK</b>
   <b>Port</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       Add an ``internal port'' <b>vlan10</b> to bridge <b>br0</b> as a VLAN access port for
       VLAN 10, and configure it with an IP address:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>add-port</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>vlan10</b>  <b>tag=10</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>vlan10</b>
              <b>type=internal</b>

              <b>ip</b> <b>addr</b> <b>add</b> <b>192.168.0.123/24</b> <b>dev</b> <b>vlan10</b>

       Add a GRE tunnel port <b>gre0</b> to remote IP address 1.2.3.4 to bridge <b>br0</b>:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>gre0</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>gre0</b>  <b>type=gre</b>  <b>op‐</b>
              <b>tions:remote_ip=1.2.3.4</b>

   <b>Port</b> <b>Mirroring</b>
       Mirror all packets received or sent on <b>eth0</b> or <b>eth1</b> onto <b>eth2</b>, assuming
       that  all  of  those  ports  exist on bridge <b>br0</b> (as a side-effect this
       causes any packets received on <b>eth2</b> to be ignored):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mirrors=@m</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@eth0</b> <b>get</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@eth1</b> <b>get</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@eth2</b> <b>get</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth2</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>   <b>--id=@m</b>    <b>create</b>    <b>Mirror</b>    <b>name=mymirror</b>    <b>select-dst-</b>
              <b>port=@eth0,@eth1</b> <b>select-src-port=@eth0,@eth1</b> <b>output-port=@eth2</b>

       Remove  the mirror created above from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the Mir‐
       ror record (since it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>--id=@rec</b> <b>get</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>mymirror</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>remove</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mirrors</b> <b>@rec</b>

       The following simpler command also works:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mirrors</b>

   <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> <b>(QoS)</b>
       Create a <b>linux-htb</b> QoS record that points to a few queues and use it on
       <b>eth0</b> and <b>eth1</b>:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>qos=@newqos</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>qos=@newqos</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>   <b>--id=@newqos</b>   <b>create</b>   <b>QoS</b>    <b>type=linux-htb</b>    <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:max-rate=1000000000</b> <b>queues=0=@q0,1=@q1</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>   <b>--id=@q0</b>   <b>create</b>   <b>Queue</b>   <b>other-config:min-rate=100000000</b>
              <b>other-config:max-rate=100000000</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@q1</b> <b>create</b> <b>Queue</b> <b>other-config:min-rate=500000000</b>

       Deconfigure the QoS record above from <b>eth1</b> only:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>qos</b>

       To deconfigure the QoS record from both <b>eth0</b> and <b>eth1</b> and  then  delete
       the  QoS record (which must be done explicitly because unreferenced QoS
       records are not automatically destroyed):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>QoS</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>--</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b>  <b>qos</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>clear</b>
              <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>qos</b>

       (This  command  will  leave two unreferenced Queue records in the data‐
       base.  To delete them, use "<b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>list</b> <b>Queue</b>" to find their  UUIDs,
       then  "<b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>destroy</b> <b>Queue</b> <u>uuid1</u> <u>uuid2</u>" to destroy each of them or
       use "<b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>Queue</b>" to delete all records.)

   <b>Connectivity</b> <b>Monitoring</b>
       Monitor connectivity to a remote maintenance point on eth0.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>cfm_mpid=1</b>

       Deconfigure connectivity monitoring from above:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>cfm_mpid</b>

   <b>NetFlow</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to send NetFlow records to UDP port 5566  on  host
       192.168.0.34, with an active timeout of 30 seconds:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>netflow=@nf</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b>  <b>--id=@nf</b>  <b>create</b>  <b>NetFlow</b>  <b>targets=\"192.168.0.34:5566\"</b> <b>ac‐</b>
              <b>tive-timeout=30</b>

       Update the NetFlow configuration created by the previous command to in‐
       stead use an active timeout of 60 seconds:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>NetFlow</b> <b>br0</b> <b>active_timeout=60</b>

       Deconfigure the NetFlow settings from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the Net‐
       Flow record (since it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>netflow</b>

   <b>sFlow</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to send sFlow records to a collector  on  10.0.0.1
       at port 6343, using <b>eth1</b>'s IP address as the source, with specific sam‐
       pling parameters:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>    <b>--</b>    <b>--id=@s</b>    <b>create</b>   <b>sFlow</b>   <b>agent=eth1</b>   <b>tar‐</b>
              <b>get=\"10.0.0.1:6343\"</b> <b>header=128</b> <b>sampling=64</b> <b>polling=10</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>sflow=@s</b>

       Deconfigure sFlow from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the sFlow record (since
       it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>sflow</b>

   <b>IPFIX</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to send one IPFIX flow record per packet sample to
       UDP port 4739 on host 192.168.0.34, with Observation Domain ID 123  and
       Observation  Point  ID 456, a flow cache active timeout of 1 minute (60
       seconds), maximum flow cache size of 13 flows,  and  flows  sampled  on
       output  port  with tunnel info(sampling on input and output port is en‐
       abled by default if not disabled) :

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>ipfix=@i</b> <b>\</b>

              <b>--</b> <b>--id=@i</b> <b>create</b>  <b>IPFIX</b>  <b>targets=\"192.168.0.34:4739\"</b>  <b>obs_do‐</b>

              <b>other_config:enable-input-sampling=false</b>    <b>other_config:enable-</b>
              <b>tunnel-sampling=true</b>

       Deconfigure  the IPFIX settings from <b>br0</b>, which also destroys the IPFIX
       record (since it is now unreferenced):

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>clear</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>ipfix</b>

   <b>802.1D</b> <b>Spanning</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(STP)</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to participate in an 802.1D spanning tree:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>stp_enable=true</b>

       Set the bridge priority of <b>br0</b> to 0x7800:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>other_config:stp-priority=0x7800</b>

       Set the path cost of port <b>eth0</b> to 10:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>other_config:stp-path-cost=10</b>

       Deconfigure STP from above:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>stp_enable=false</b>

   <b>Multicast</b> <b>Snooping</b>
       Configure bridge <b>br0</b> to enable multicast snooping:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>mcast_snooping_enable=true</b>

       Set the multicast snooping aging time <b>br0</b> to 300 seconds:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>Bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>   <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-aging-</b>
              <b>time=300</b>

       Set the multicast snooping table size <b>br0</b> to 2048 entries:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b>   <b>set</b>  <b>Bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-table-</b>
              <b>size=2048</b>

       Disable flooding of unregistered multicast packets to all  ports.  When
       set  to  <b>true</b>, the switch will send unregistered multicast packets only
       to ports connected to multicast routers. When it is set to  <b>false</b>,  the
       switch  will send them to all ports. This command disables the flood of
       unregistered packets on bridge <b>br0</b>.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b>  <b>Bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-disable-</b>
              <b>flood-unregistered=true</b>

       Enable  flooding  of  multicast  packets (except Reports) on a specific
       port.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Port</b> <b>eth1</b> <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-flood=true</b>

       Enable flooding of Reports on a specific port.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b>  <b>Port</b>  <b>eth1</b>  <b>other_config:mcast-snooping-flood-re‐</b>
              <b>ports=true</b>

       Deconfigure multicasting snooping from above:

   <b>802.1D-2004</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>Spanning</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(RSTP)</b>
       Configure  bridge  <b>br0</b>  to participate in an 802.1D-2004 Rapid Spanning
       Tree:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>rstp_enable=true</b>

              <b>dress=00:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa</b>

       Set  the  bridge priority of <b>br0</b> to 0x7000. The value must be specified
       in decimal notation and should be a multiple of 4096  (if  not,  it  is
       rounded  down  to  the  nearest multiple of 4096). The default priority
       value is 0x800 (32768).

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>other_config:rstp-priority=28672</b>

       Set the bridge ageing time of <b>br0</b> to 1000  s.  The  ageing  time  value
       should be between 10 s and 1000000 s. The default value is 300 s.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>other_config:rstp-ageing-time=1000</b>
