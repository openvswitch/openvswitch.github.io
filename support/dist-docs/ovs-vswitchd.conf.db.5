ovs-vswitchd\[char46]conf\[char46]db \- Open_vSwitch database schema
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open vSwitch daemon\[char46] The top-level configuration for the daemon is the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table, which must have exactly one record\[char46] Records in other tables are significant only when they can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] Records that are not reachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted from the database, except for records in a few distinguished ``root set\(cq\(cq tables\[char46]
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
.PP
Most tables contain two special columns, named \fBother_config\fR and \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46] These columns have the same form and purpose each place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space later\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBother_config\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used features\[char46] Supported keys, along with the forms taken by their values, are documented individually for each table\[char46]
.IP
A few tables do not have \fBother_config\fR columns because no key-value pairs have yet been defined for them\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself\[char46] System integrators should either use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be unique\[char46] In some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined that are likely to be widely useful, they are documented individually for each table\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

.IP "\fBother_config : flow-restore-wait\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts up, it has an empty flow table and therefore it handles all arriving packets in its default fashion according to its configuration, by dropping them or sending them to an OpenFlow controller or switching them as a standalone switch\[char46] This behavior is ordinarily desirable\[char46] However, if \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is restarting as part of a ``hot-upgrade,\(cq\(cq then this leads to a relatively long period during which packets are mishandled\[char46]
.IP
This option allows for improvement\[char46] When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts with this value set as \fBtrue\fR, it will neither flush or expire previously set datapath flows nor will it send and receive any packets to or from the datapath\[char46] When this value is later set to \fBfalse\fR, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will start receiving packets from the datapath and re-setup the flows\[char46]
.IP
Additionally, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is prevented from connecting to controllers when this value is set to \fBtrue\fR\[char46] This prevents controllers from making changes to the flow table in the middle of flow restoration, which could result in undesirable intermediate states\[char46] Once this value has been set to \fBfalse\fR and the desired flow state has been restored, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will be able to reconnect to controllers and process any new flow table modifications\[char46]

When a flow is installed in the datapath with an empty action list, it indicates an implicit \(dqdrop\(dq action\[char46] Most datapaths report this for event for statistics and monitoring (in datapath-specific ways)\[char46]

However, if any of the per-bridge or per-flow sampling functionalities are enabled (e\[char46]g: sFlow, IPFIX, local sampling), the action list might not be empty, but contain an action to implement such functionality\[char46] This makes the datapaths not report the packet drop\[char46]

When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible for setting up all flows on the switch\[char46] Thus, if the connection to the controller fails, no new network connections can be set up\[char46] If the connection to the controller stays down long enough, no packets can pass through the switch at all\[char46] This setting determines the switch\(cqs response to such a situation\[char46] It may be set to one of the following:
.RS
.TP
\fBstandalone\fR
If no message is received from the controller for three times the inactivity probe interval (see \fBinactivity_probe\fR), then Open vSwitch will take over responsibility for setting up flows\[char46] In this mode, Open vSwitch causes the bridge to act like an ordinary MAC-learning switch\[char46] Open vSwitch will continue to retry connecting to the controller in the background and, when the connection succeeds, it will discontinue its standalone behavior\[char46]
.TP
\fBsecure\fR
Open vSwitch will not set up flows on its own when the controller connection fails or when no controllers are defined\[char46] The bridge will continue to retry connecting to any defined controllers forever\[char46]
.RE
.IP
The default is \fBstandalone\fR if the value is unset, but future versions of Open vSwitch may change the default\[char46]
.IP
The \fBstandalone\fR mode can create forwarding loops on a bridge that has more than one uplink port unless STP is enabled\[char46] To avoid loops on such a bridge, configure \fBsecure\fR mode or enable STP (see \fBstp_enable\fR)\[char46]

.ST "VLAN Configuration:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
In short, a VLAN (short for ``virtual LAN\(cq\(cq) is a way to partition a single switch into multiple switches\[char46] VLANs can be confusing, so for an introduction, please refer to the question ``What\(cqs a VLAN?\(cq\(cq in the Open vSwitch FAQ\[char46]
.PP
.PP
A VLAN is sometimes encoded into a packet using a 802\[char46]1Q or 802\[char46]1ad VLAN header, but every packet is part of some VLAN whether or not it is encoded in the packet\[char46] (A packet that appears to have no VLAN is part of VLAN 0, by default\[char46]) As a result, it\(cqs useful to think of a VLAN as a metadata property of a packet, separate from how the VLAN is encoded\[char46] For a given port, this column determines how the encoding of a packet that ingresses or egresses the port maps to the packet\(cqs VLAN\[char46] When a packet enters the switch, its VLAN is determined based on its setting in this column and its VLAN headers, if any, and then, conceptually, the VLAN headers are then stripped off\[char46] Conversely, when a packet exits the switch, its VLAN and the settings in this column determine what VLAN headers, if any, are pushed onto the packet before it egresses the port\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The VLAN configuration in this column affects Open vSwitch only when it is doing ``normal switching\[char46]\(cq\(cq It does not affect flows set up by an OpenFlow controller, outside of the OpenFlow ``normal action\[char46]\(cq\(cq
.PP
.PP
Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:
.RS
.TP
trunk
A trunk port carries packets on one or more specified VLANs specified in the \fBtrunks\fR column (often, on every VLAN)\[char46] A packet that ingresses on a trunk port is in the VLAN specified in its 802\[char46]1Q header, or VLAN 0 if the packet has no 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46] A packet that egresses through a trunk port will have an 802\[char46]1Q header if it has a nonzero VLAN ID\[char46]
.IP
Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged with a VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped\[char46]
.TP
access
An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN specified in the \fBtag\fR column\[char46] Packets egressing on an access port have no 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]
.IP
Any packet with an 802\[char46]1Q header with a nonzero VLAN ID that ingresses on an access port is dropped, regardless of whether the VLAN ID in the header is the access port\(cqs VLAN ID\[char46]
.TP
native-tagged
A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with the exception that a packet without an 802\[char46]1Q header that ingresses on a native-tagged port is in the ``native VLAN\(cq\(cq (specified in the \fBtag\fR column)\[char46]
.TP
native-untagged
A native-untagged port resembles a native-tagged port, with the exception that a packet that egresses on a native-untagged port in the native VLAN will not have an 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]
.TP
dot1q-tunnel
A dot1q-tunnel port is somewhat like an access port\[char46] Like an access port, it carries packets on the single VLAN specified in the \fBtag\fR column and this VLAN, called the service VLAN, does not appear in an 802\[char46]1Q header for packets that ingress or egress on the port\[char46] The main difference lies in the behavior when packets that include a 802\[char46]1Q header ingress on the port\[char46] Whereas an access port drops such packets, a dot1q-tunnel port treats these as double-tagged with the outer service VLAN \fBtag\fR and the inner customer VLAN taken from the 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46] Correspondingly, to egress on the port, a packet outer VLAN (or only VLAN) must be \fBtag\fR, which is removed before egress, which exposes the inner (customer) VLAN if one is present\[char46]
.IP
If \fBcvlans\fR is set, only allows packets in the specified customer VLANs\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
A packet will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of the packet, as described by the rules above\[char46]
.IP "\fBvlan_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBaccess\fR, \fBdot1q\-tunnel\fR, \fBnative\-tagged\fR, \fBnative\-untagged\fR, or \fBtrunk\fR"
The VLAN mode of the port, as described above\[char46] When this column is empty, a default mode is selected as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
If \fBtag\fR contains a value, the port is an access port\[char46] The \fBtrunks\fR column should be empty\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Otherwise, the port is a trunk port\[char46] The \fBtrunks\fR column value is honored if it is present\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
For an access port, the port\(cqs implicitly tagged VLAN\[char46] For a native-tagged or native-untagged port, the port\(cqs native VLAN\[char46] Must be empty if this is a trunk port\[char46]

For a dot1q-tunnel port, this is the TPID for the service tag, that is, for the 802\[char46]1Q header that contains the service VLAN ID\[char46] Because packets that actually ingress and egress a dot1q-tunnel port do not include an 802\[char46]1Q header for the service VLAN, this does not affect packets on the dot1q-tunnel port itself\[char46] Rather, it determines the service VLAN for a packet that ingresses on a dot1q-tunnel port and egresses on a trunk port\[char46]
.IP
The value \fB802\[char46]1ad\fR specifies TPID 0x88a8, which is also the default if the setting is omitted\[char46] The value \fB802\[char46]1q\fR specifies TPID 0x8100\[char46]
.IP
For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : priority-tags\fR: optional string, one of \fBalways\fR, \fBif\-nonzero\fR, or \fBnever\fR"
An 802\[char46]1Q header contains two important pieces of information: a VLAN ID and a priority\[char46] A frame with a zero VLAN ID, called a ``priority-tagged\(cq\(cq frame, is supposed to be treated the same way as a frame without an 802\[char46]1Q header at all (except for the priority)\[char46]
.IP
However, some network elements ignore any frame that has 802\[char46]1Q header at all, even when the VLAN ID is zero\[char46] Therefore, by default Open vSwitch does not output priority-tagged frames, instead omitting the 802\[char46]1Q header entirely if the VLAN ID is zero\[char46] Set this key to \fBif\-nonzero\fR to enable priority-tagged frames on a port\[char46]
.IP
For \fBif\-nonzero\fR Open vSwitch omits the 802\[char46]1Q header on output if both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero\[char46] Set to \fBalways\fR to retain the 802\[char46]1Q header in such frames as well\[char46]
.IP
All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero VLAN ID, so this setting is not meaningful on native-tagged ports\[char46]
.ST "Bonding Configuration:"

The MAC address to use for this port for the purpose of choosing the bridge\(cqs MAC address\[char46] This column does not necessarily reflect the port\(cqs actual MAC address, nor will setting it change the port\(cqs actual MAC address\[char46]
.IP "\fBfake_bridge\fR: boolean"
Does this port represent a sub-bridge for its tagged VLAN within the Bridge? See ovs-vsctl(8) for more information\[char46]
.IP "\fBprotected\fR: boolean"
The protected ports feature allows certain ports to be designated as protected\[char46] Traffic between protected ports is blocked\[char46] Protected ports can send traffic to unprotected ports\[char46] Unprotected ports can send traffic to any port\[char46] Default is false\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : fake-bridge-*\fR: optional string"
External IDs for a fake bridge (see the \fBfake_bridge\fR column) are defined by prefixing a \fBBridge\fR \fBexternal_ids\fR key with \fBfake\-bridge\-\fR, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBfake\-bridge\-bridge\-id\fR\[char46]

.IP "\fBname\fR: immutable string (must be unique within table)"
Interface name\[char46] Should be alphanumeric\[char46] For non-bonded port, this should be the same as the port name\[char46] It must otherwise be unique among the names of ports, interfaces, and bridges on a host\[char46]
.IP
The maximum length of an interface name depends on the underlying datapath:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The names of interfaces implemented as Linux and BSD network devices, including interfaces with type \fBinternal\fR, \fBtap\fR, or \fBsystem\fR plus the different types of tunnel ports, are limited to 15 bytes\[char46] Windows limits these names to 255 bytes\[char46]
.IP \(bu
The names of patch ports are not used in the underlying datapath, so operating system restrictions do not apply\[char46] Thus, they may have arbitrary length\[char46]
.RE
.IP
Regardless of other restrictions, OpenFlow only supports 15-byte names, which means that \fBovs\-ofctl\fR and OpenFlow controllers will show names truncated to 15 bytes\[char46]
.IP "\fBifindex\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295"
A positive interface index as defined for SNMP MIB-II in RFCs 1213 and 2863, if the interface has one, otherwise 0\[char46] The ifindex is useful for seamless integration with protocols such as SNMP and sFlow\[char46]
.IP "\fBmac_in_use\fR: optional string"
The MAC address in use by this interface\[char46]
.IP "\fBmac\fR: optional string"
Ethernet address to set for this interface\[char46] If unset then the default MAC address is used:
.RS
.IP \(bu
For the local interface, the default is the lowest-numbered MAC address among the other bridge ports, either the value of the \fBmac\fR in its \fBPort\fR record, if set, or its actual MAC (for bonded ports, the MAC of its member whose name is first in alphabetical order)\[char46] Internal ports and bridge ports that are used as port mirroring destinations (see the \fBMirror\fR table) are ignored\[char46]
.IP \(bu
For other internal interfaces, the default MAC is randomly generated\[char46]
.IP \(bu
External interfaces typically have a MAC address associated with their hardware\[char46]
.RE
.IP
Some interfaces may not have a software-controllable MAC address\[char46] This option only affects internal ports\[char46] For other type ports, you can change the MAC address outside Open vSwitch, using ip command\[char46]
.IP "\fBerror\fR: optional string"
If the configuration of the port failed, as indicated by \-1 in \fBofport\fR, Open vSwitch sets this column to an error description in human readable form\[char46] Otherwise, Open vSwitch clears this column\[char46]
.ST "OpenFlow Port Number:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
When a client adds a new interface, Open vSwitch chooses an OpenFlow port number for the new port\[char46] If the client that adds the port fills in \fBofport_request\fR, then Open vSwitch tries to use its value as the OpenFlow port number\[char46] Otherwise, or if the requested port number is already in use or cannot be used for another reason, Open vSwitch automatically assigns a free port number\[char46] Regardless of how the port number was obtained, Open vSwitch then reports in \fBofport\fR the port number actually assigned\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Open vSwitch limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive\[char46] Controllers therefore have free use of ports 32,768 and up\[char46]
.IP "\fBofport\fR: optional integer"
OpenFlow port number for this interface\[char46] Open vSwitch sets this column\(cqs value, so other clients should treat it as read-only\[char46]
.IP
The OpenFlow ``local\(cq\(cq port (\fBOFPP_LOCAL\fR) is 65,534\[char46] The other valid port numbers are in the range 1 to 65,279, inclusive\[char46] Value \-1 indicates an error adding the interface\[char46]
.IP "\fBofport_request\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 65,279"
Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface\[char46]
.IP
A client should ideally set this column\(cqs value in the same database transaction that it uses to create the interface\[char46] Open vSwitch version 2\[char46]1 and later will honor a later request for a specific port number, althuogh it might confuse some controllers: OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number change, so Open vSwitch represents it over OpenFlow as a port deletion followed immediately by a port addition\[char46]
.IP
If \fBofport_request\fR is set or changed to some other port\(cqs automatically assigned port number, Open vSwitch chooses a new port number for the latter port\[char46]

.IP "\fBtype\fR: string"
The interface type\[char46] The types supported by a particular instance of Open vSwitch are listed in the \fBiface_types\fR column in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] The following types are defined:
.RS
.TP
\fBsystem\fR
An ordinary network device, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBeth0\fR on Linux\[char46] Sometimes referred to as ``external interfaces\(cq\(cq since they are generally connected to hardware external to that on which the Open vSwitch is running\[char46] The empty string is a synonym for \fBsystem\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBinternal\fR
A simulated network device that sends and receives traffic\[char46] An internal interface whose \fBname\fR is the same as its bridge\(cqs \fBname\fR is called the ``local interface\[char46]\(cq\(cq It does not make sense to bond an internal interface, so the terms ``port\(cq\(cq and ``interface\(cq\(cq are often used imprecisely for internal interfaces\[char46]
.TP
\fBtap\fR
A TUN/TAP device managed by Open vSwitch\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch checks the interface state before send packets to the device\[char46] When it is \fBdown\fR, the packets are dropped and the tx_dropped statistic is updated accordingly\[char46] Older versions of Open vSwitch did not check the interface state and then the tx_packets was incremented along with tx_dropped\[char46]
.TP
\fBgeneve\fR
An Ethernet over Geneve (\fBhttp://tools\[char46]ietf\[char46]org/html/draft\-ietf\-nvo3\-geneve\fR) IPv4/IPv6 tunnel\[char46] A description of how to match and set Geneve options can be found in the \fBovs\-ofctl\fR manual page\[char46]
.TP
\fBgre\fR
Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over IPv4 tunnel, configurable to encapsulate layer 2 or layer 3 traffic\[char46]
.TP
\fBip6gre\fR
Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over IPv6 tunnel, encapsulate layer 2 traffic\[char46]
.TP
\fBvxlan\fR
An Ethernet tunnel over the UDP-based VXLAN protocol described in RFC 7348\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch uses IANA-assigned UDP destination port 4789\[char46] The source port used for VXLAN traffic varies on a per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral port range\[char46]
.TP
\fBlisp\fR
This port type is deprecated\[char46]
.IP
A layer 3 tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based Locator/ID Separation Protocol (RFC 6830)\[char46]
.IP
Only IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported by the protocol, and they are sent and received without an Ethernet header\[char46] Traffic to/from LISP ports is expected to be configured explicitly, and the ports are not intended to participate in learning based switching\[char46] As such, they are always excluded from packet flooding\[char46]
.TP
\fBstt\fR
This port type is deprecated\[char46]
.IP
The Stateless TCP Tunnel (STT) is particularly useful when tunnel endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of standard network interface cards to improve performance\[char46] STT utilizes a TCP-like header inside the IP header\[char46] It is stateless, i\[char46]e\[char46], there is no TCP connection state of any kind associated with the tunnel\[char46] The TCP-like header is used to leverage the capabilities of existing network interface cards, but should not be interpreted as implying any sort of connection state between endpoints\[char46]
.IP
Since the STT protocol does not engage in the usual TCP 3-way handshake, so it will have difficulty traversing stateful firewalls\[char46]
.IP
The protocol is documented at \fBhttps://tools\[char46]ietf\[char46]org/html/draft\-davie\-stt\fR\[char46] All traffic uses a default destination port of 7471\[char46]
.TP
\fBpatch\fR
A pair of virtual devices that act as a patch cable\[char46]
.TP
\fBgtpu\fR
GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is a group of IP-based communications protocols used to carry general packet radio service (GPRS) within GSM, UMTS and LTE networks\[char46] GTP-U is used for carrying user data within the GPRS core network and between the radio access network and the core network\[char46] The user data transported can be packets in any of IPv4, IPv6, or PPP formats\[char46]
.IP
The protocol is documented at http://www\[char46]3gpp\[char46]org/DynaReport/29281\[char46]htm
.IP
Open vSwitch uses UDP destination port 2152\[char46] The source port used for GTP traffic varies on a per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral port range\[char46]
.TP
\fBBareudp\fR
The Bareudp tunnel provides a generic L3 encapsulation support for tunnelling different L3 protocols like MPLS, IP, NSH etc\[char46] inside a UDP tunnel\[char46]
.TP
\fBsrv6\fR
Segment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) tunnel encapsulates L3 traffic as \(dqIPv6 in IPv6\(dq or \(dqIPv4 in IPv6\(dq with Segment Routing Header (SRH) defined in RFC 8754\[char46] The segment list in SRH can be set using a SRv6 specific option\[char46]

These settings control ingress policing for packets received on this interface\[char46] On a physical interface, this limits the rate at which traffic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a virtual interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at which the VM is able to transmit\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops packets received in excess of the configured rate\[char46] Due to its simplicity, policing is usually less accurate and less effective than egress QoS (which is configured using the \fBQoS\fR and \fBQueue\fR tables)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Policing settings can be set with byte rate or packet rate, and they can be configured together, in which case they take effect together, that means the smaller speed limit of them is in effect\[char46]

Currently, byte rate policing is implemented on Linux and OVS with DPDK, while packet rate policing is only implemented on Linux\[char46] Both Linux and OVS DPDK implementations use a simple ``token bucket\(cq\(cq approach\[char46]

Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and especially with fragmented IP packets\[char46] Suppose that there is enough network activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time\[char46] Then this token bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the period depending on packet size and on the configured rate\[char46] All of the fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a group\[char46] In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped\[char46] IP does not provide any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining fragments\[char46] In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what will happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will recur, or the sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped and data will simply be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do)\[char46] Either way, it is possible that no forward progress will ever occur\[char46]

Faults can be triggered for several reasons\[char46] Most importantly they are triggered when no CCMs are received for a period of 3\[char46]5 times the transmission interval\[char46] Faults are also triggered when any CCMs indicate that a Remote Maintenance Point is not receiving CCMs but able to send them\[char46] Finally, a fault is triggered if a CCM is received which indicates unexpected configuration\[char46] Notably, this case arises when a CCM is received which advertises the local MPID\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : recv\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to a lack of CCMs received on the \fBInterface\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : rdi\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM with the RDI bit flagged\[char46] Endpoints set the RDI bit in their CCMs when they are not receiving CCMs themselves\[char46] This typically indicates a unidirectional connectivity failure\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : maid\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM with a MAID other than the one Open vSwitch uses\[char46] CFM broadcasts are tagged with an identification number in addition to the MPID called the MAID\[char46] Open vSwitch only supports receiving CCM broadcasts tagged with the MAID it uses internally\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : loopback\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM advertising the same MPID configured in the \fBcfm_mpid\fR column of this \fBInterface\fR\[char46] This may indicate a loop in the network\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : overflow\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered because the CFM module received CCMs from more remote endpoints than it can keep track of\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : override\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was manually triggered by an administrator using an \fBovs\-appctl\fR command\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : interval\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM frame having an invalid interval\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_opstate\fR: optional string, either \fBdown\fR or \fBup\fR"
When in extended mode, indicates the operational state of the remote endpoint as either \fBup\fR or \fBdown\fR\[char46] See \fBother_config:cfm_opstate\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_health\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 100"
Indicates the health of the interface as a percentage of CCM frames received over 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs\[char46] The health of an interface is undefined if it is communicating with more than one \fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR\[char46] It reduces if healthy heartbeats are not received at the expected rate, and gradually improves as healthy heartbeats are received at the desired rate\[char46] Every 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs, the health of the interface is refreshed\[char46]
.IP
As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for several reasons\[char46] The link health will deteriorate even if heartbeats are received but they are reported to be unhealthy\[char46] An unhealthy heartbeat in this context is a heartbeat for which either some fault is set or is out of sequence\[char46] The interface health can be 100 only on receiving healthy heartbeats at the desired rate\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR: set of integers"
When CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will occasionally receive CCM broadcasts\[char46] These broadcasts contain the MPID of the sending Maintenance Point\[char46] The list of MPIDs from which this \fBInterface\fR is receiving broadcasts from is regularly collected and written to this column\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The interval, in milliseconds, between transmissions of CFM heartbeats\[char46] Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate a connectivity fault\[char46]
.IP
In standard operation only intervals of 3, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 60,000, or 600,000 ms are supported\[char46] Other values will be rounded down to the nearest value on the list\[char46] Extended mode (see \fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR) supports any interval up to 65,535 ms\[char46] In either mode, the default is 1000 ms\[char46]
.IP
We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_extended\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, the CFM module operates in extended mode\[char46] This causes it to use a nonstandard destination address to avoid conflicting with compliant implementations which may be running concurrently on the network\[char46] Furthermore, extended mode increases the accuracy of the \fBcfm_interval\fR configuration parameter by breaking wire compatibility with 802\[char46]1ag compliant implementations\[char46] And extended mode allows eight byte MPIDs\[char46] Defaults to \fBfalse\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_demand\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, and \fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR is true, the CFM module operates in demand mode\[char46] When in demand mode, traffic received on the \fBInterface\fR is used to indicate liveness\[char46] CCMs are still transmitted and received\[char46] At least one CCM must be received every 100 * \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR amount of time\[char46] Otherwise, even if traffic are received, the CFM module will raise the connectivity fault\[char46]
.IP
Demand mode has a couple of caveats:
.RS
.IP \(bu
To ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull statistics from the datapath, the fault detection interval is set to 3\[char46]5 * MAX(\fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR, 500) ms\[char46]
.IP \(bu
To avoid ambiguity, demand mode disables itself when there are multiple remote maintenance points\[char46]
.IP \(bu
If the \fBInterface\fR is heavily congested, CCMs containing the \fBother_config:cfm_opstate\fR status may be dropped causing changes in the operational state to be delayed\[char46] Similarly, if CCMs containing the RDI bit are not received, unidirectional link failures may not be detected\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_opstate\fR: optional string, either \fBdown\fR or \fBup\fR"
When \fBdown\fR, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as operationally down without triggering a fault\[char46] This allows remote maintenance points to choose not to forward traffic to the \fBInterface\fR on which this CFM module is running\[char46] Currently, in Open vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects \fBInterface\fRs participating in bonds, and the bundle OpenFlow action\[char46] This setting is ignored when CFM is not in extended mode\[char46] Defaults to \fBup\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_ccm_vlan\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
When set, the CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs it generates with the given value\[char46] May be the string \fBrandom\fR in which case each CCM will be tagged with a different randomly generated VLAN\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_ccm_pcp\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 7"
When set, the CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs it generates with the given PCP value, the VLAN ID of the tag is governed by the value of \fBother_config:cfm_ccm_vlan\fR\[char46] If \fBother_config:cfm_ccm_vlan\fR is unset, a VLAN ID of zero is used\[char46]

Open vSwitch supports limiting the number of flows that may be installed in a flow table, via the \fBflow_limit\fR column\[char46] When adding a flow would exceed this limit, by default Open vSwitch reports an error, but there are two ways to configure Open vSwitch to instead delete (``evict\(cq\(cq) a flow to make room for the new one:

When a flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict is chosen through an approximation of the following algorithm\[char46] This algorithm is used regardless of how eviction was enabled:
.RS
.IP 1. .4in
Divide the flows in the table into groups based on the values of the fields or subfields specified in the \fBgroups\fR column, so that all of the flows in a given group have the same values for those fields\[char46] If a flow does not specify a given field, that field\(cqs value is treated as 0\[char46] If \fBgroups\fR is empty, then all of the flows in the flow table are treated as a single group\[char46]
.IP 2. .4in

.PP
.IP "\fBprefixes\fR: set of up to 4 strings"
This string set specifies which fields should be used for address prefix tracking\[char46] Prefix tracking allows the classifier to skip rules with longer than necessary prefixes, resulting in better wildcarding for datapath flows\[char46]
.IP
Prefix tracking may be beneficial when a flow table contains matches on IP address fields with different prefix lengths\[char46] For example, when a flow table contains IP address matches on both full addresses and proper prefixes, the full address matches will typically cause the datapath flow to un-wildcard the whole address field (depending on flow entry priorities)\[char46] In this case each packet with a different address gets handed to the userspace for flow processing and generates its own datapath flow\[char46] With prefix tracking enabled for the address field in question packets with addresses matching shorter prefixes would generate datapath flows where the irrelevant address bits are wildcarded, allowing the same datapath flow to handle all the packets within the prefix in question\[char46] In this case many userspace upcalls can be avoided and the overall performance can be better\[char46]
.IP
This is a performance optimization only, so packets will receive the same treatment with or without prefix tracking\[char46]
.IP
The supported fields are: \fBtun_id\fR, \fBtun_src\fR, \fBtun_dst\fR, \fBtun_ipv6_src\fR, \fBtun_ipv6_dst\fR, \fBnw_src\fR, \fBnw_dst\fR (or aliases \fBip_src\fR and \fBip_dst\fR), \fBipv6_src\fR, and \fBipv6_dst\fR\[char46] (Using this feature for \fBtun_id\fR would only make sense if the tunnel IDs have prefix structure similar to IP addresses\[char46])
.IP
By default, the \fBprefixes=ip_dst,ip_src,ipv6_dst,ipv6_src\fR are used on each flow table\[char46] This instructs the flow classifier to track the IPv4 and IPv6 destination and source addresses used by the rules in this specific flow table\[char46]
.IP
The keyword \fBnone\fR is recognized as an explicit override of the default values, causing no prefix fields to be tracked\[char46]
.IP
To set the prefix fields, the flow table record needs to exist:
.RS

\fBPlease note:\fR Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that contains unmanaged switches\[char46] Consider an unmanaged physical switch with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2, connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received packets into VLAN 123 on port 2\[char46] Suppose that the end host sends a packet on port 1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2\[char46] The Open vSwitch forwards this packet to its destination and then reflects it back on port 2 in VLAN 123\[char46] This reflected packet causes the unmanaged physical switch to replace the MAC learning table entry, which correctly pointed to port 1, with one that incorrectly points to port 2\[char46] Afterward, the physical switch will direct packets destined for the end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end host on port 1, disrupting connectivity\[char46] If mirroring to a VLAN is desired in this scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced by one that learns Ethernet addresses on a per-VLAN basis\[char46] In addition, learning should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored traffic\[char46] If this is not done then intermediate switches will learn the MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traffic\[char46] If packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored, then they will be dropped since the switch will attempt to send them out the input port\[char46] Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to correctly send the packet out all ports configured for that VLAN\[char46] If Open vSwitch is being used as an intermediate switch, learning can be disabled by adding the mirrored VLAN to \fBflood_vlans\fR in the appropriate \fBBridge\fR table or tables\[char46]

Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers\[char46] A bridge may have any number of each kind:
.RS
.TP
Primary controllers
This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow specifications\[char46] Usually, a primary controller implements a network policy by taking charge of the switch\(cqs flow table\[char46]
.IP
The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the \fBBridge\fR table applies to primary controllers\[char46]
.IP
When multiple primary controllers are configured, Open vSwitch connects to all of them simultaneously\[char46] OpenFlow provides few facilities to allow multiple controllers to coordinate in interacting with a single switch, so more than one primary controller should be specified only if the controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each other\[char46]
.TP
Service controllers
These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are intended for occasional support and maintenance use, e\[char46]g\[char46] with \fBovs\-ofctl\fR\[char46] Usually a service controller connects only briefly to inspect or modify some of a switch\(cqs state\[char46]

In this mode, this controller\(cqs OpenFlow traffic travels over the bridge associated with the controller\[char46] With this setting, Open vSwitch allows traffic to and from the controller regardless of the contents of the OpenFlow flow table\[char46] (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never be able to connect to the controller, because it did not have a flow to enable it\[char46]) This is the most common connection mode because it is not necessary to maintain two independent networks\[char46]

Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to controller before sending an inactivity probe message\[char46] If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the controller for the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe\[char46] If a response is not received for the same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect\[char46] Default is implementation-specific\[char46] A value of 0 disables inactivity probes\[char46]
.ST "Asynchronous Messages:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers spontanenously, that is, not in response to any request from the controller\[char46] These messages are called ``asynchronous messages\[char46]\(cq\(cq These columns allow asynchronous messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best use of network resources\[char46]
.IP "\fBenable_async_messages\fR: optional boolean"
The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at time of connection establishment, which means that a controller can receive asynchronous messages, potentially many of them, even if it turns them off immediately after connecting\[char46] Set this column to \fBfalse\fR to change Open vSwitch behavior to disable, by default, all asynchronous messages\[char46] The controller can use the \fBNXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG\fR Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn on any messages that it does want to receive, if any\[char46]
.ST "Controller Rate Limiting:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
A switch can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow protocol\[char46] Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate can overwhelm a controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow connection for other purposes, increase the latency of flow setup, and use an unreasonable amount of bandwidth\[char46] Therefore, Open vSwitch supports limiting the rate of packet forwarding to a controller\[char46]
.PP
.PP
There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to be sent to a controller: either the packet ``misses\(cq\(cq in the flow table, that is, there is no matching flow, or a flow table action says to send the packet to the controller\[char46] Open vSwitch limits the rate of each kind of packet separately at the configured rate\[char46] Therefore, the actual rate that packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the configured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons\[char46]
.PP
.PP
This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow connection\[char46] It is not general-purpose QoS\[char46] See the \fBQoS\fR table for quality of service configuration, and \fBingress_policing_rate\fR in the \fBInterface\fR table for ingress policing configuration\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_queue_size\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 512"
This sets the maximum size of the queue of packets that need to be sent to this OpenFlow controller\[char46] The value must be less than 512\[char46] If not specified the queue size is limited to the value set for the management controller in \fBother_config:controller-queue-size\fR if present or 100 packets by default\[char46] Note: increasing the queue size might have a negative impact on latency\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 100"
The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the OpenFlow controller, in packets per second\[char46] If no value is specified, rate limiting is disabled\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 25"
When a high rate triggers rate-limiting, Open vSwitch queues packets to the controller for each port and transmits them to the controller at the configured rate\[char46] This value limits the number of queued packets\[char46] Ports on a bridge share the packet queue fairly\[char46]
.IP
This value has no effect unless \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR is configured\[char46] The current default when this value is not specified is one-quarter of \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR, meaning that queuing can delay forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms\[char46]

In this mode, this connection\(cqs traffic travels over a bridge managed by Open vSwitch\[char46] With this setting, Open vSwitch allows traffic to and from the client regardless of the contents of the OpenFlow flow table\[char46] (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never be able to connect to the client, because it did not have a flow to enable it\[char46]) This is the most common connection mode because it is not necessary to maintain two independent networks\[char46]

.IP "\fBdatapath_version\fR: string"
Reports the version number of the Open vSwitch datapath in use\[char46] This allows management software to detect and report discrepancies between Open vSwitch userspace and datapath versions\[char46] (The \fBovs_version\fR column in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR reports the Open vSwitch userspace version\[char46]) The version reported depends on the datapath in use:
.RS
.IP \(bu
When the kernel module included in the Open vSwitch source tree is used, this column reports the Open vSwitch version from which the module was taken\[char46]
.IP \(bu
When the kernel module that is part of the upstream Linux kernel is used, this column reports \fB<unknown>\fR\[char46]
.IP \(bu
When the datapath is built into the \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR binary, this column reports \fB<built\-in>\fR\[char46] A built-in datapath is by definition the same version as the rest of the Open vSwitch userspace\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Other datapaths (such as the Hyper-V kernel datapath) currently report \fB<unknown>\fR\[char46]
.RE
.IP
A version discrepancy between \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR and the datapath in use is not normally cause for alarm\[char46] The Open vSwitch kernel datapaths for Linux and Hyper-V, in particular, are designed for maximum inter-version compatibility: any userspace version works with with any kernel version\[char46] Some reasons do exist to insist on particular user/kernel pairings\[char46] First, newer kernel versions add new features, that can only be used by new-enough userspace, e\[char46]g\[char46] VXLAN tunneling requires certain minimal userspace and kernel versions\[char46] Second, as an extension to the first reason, some newer kernel versions add new features for enhancing performance that only new-enough userspace versions can take advantage of\[char46]
.IP "\fBct_zones\fR: map of integer-\fBCT_Zone\fR pairs, key in range 0 to 65,535"
Configuration for connection tracking zones\[char46] Each pair maps from a zone id to a configuration for that zone\[char46] Zone \fB0\fR applies to the default zone (ie, the one used if a zone is not specified in connection tracking-related OpenFlow matches and actions)\[char46]
.ST "Capabilities:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
The \fBcapabilities\fR column reports a datapath\(cqs features\[char46] For the \fBnetdev\fR datapath, the capabilities are fixed for a given version of Open vSwitch because this datapath is built into the \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR binary\[char46] The Linux kernel and Windows and other datapaths, which are external to OVS userspace, can vary in version and capabilities independently from \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Some of these features indicate whether higher-level Open vSwitch features are available\[char46] For example, OpenFlow features for connection-tracking are available only when \fBcapabilities:ct_state\fR is \fBtrue\fR\[char46] A controller that wishes to determine whether a feature is supported could, therefore, consult the relevant capabilities in this table\[char46] However, as a general rule, it is better for a controller to try to use the higher-level feature and use the result as an indication of support, since the low-level capabilities are more likely to shift over time than the high-level features that rely on them\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : max_vlan_headers\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Number of 802\[char46]1q VLAN headers supported by the datapath, as probed by the \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR slow path\[char46] If the datapath supports more VLAN headers than the slow path, this reports the slow path\(cqs limit\[char46] The value of \fBother-config:vlan-limit\fR in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table does not influence the number reported here\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : recirc\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If this is true, then the datapath supports recirculation, specifically OVS_KEY_ATTR_RECIRC_ID\[char46] Recirculation enables higher performance for MPLS and active-active load balancing bonding modes\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : lb_output_action\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If this is true, then the datapath supports optimized balance-tcp bond mode\[char46] This capability replaces existing \fBhash\fR and \fBrecirc\fR actions with new action \fBlb_output\fR and avoids recirculation of packet in datapath\[char46] It is supported only for balance-tcp bond mode in netdev datapath\[char46] The new action gives higher performance by using bond buckets instead of post recirculation flows for selection of member port from bond\[char46] By default this new action is disabled, however it can be enabled by setting \fBother-config:lb-output-action\fR in \fBPort\fR table\[char46]
.ST "Connection-Tracking Capabilities:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
These capabilities are granular because Open vSwitch and its datapaths added support for connection tracking over several releases, with features added individually over that time\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_state\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_STATE, which indicates support for the bits in the OpenFlow \fBct_state\fR field (see \fBovs\-fields\fR(7)) other than \fBsnat\fR and \fBdnat\fR, which have a separate capability\[char46]
.IP
If this is false, the datapath does not support connection-tracking at all and the remaining connection-tracking capabilities should all be false\[char46] In this case, Open vSwitch will reject flows that match on the \fBct_state\fR field or use the \fBct\fR action\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_state_nat\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, it means that the datapath supports the \fBsnat\fR and \fBdnat\fR flags in the OpenFlow \fBct_state\fR field\[char46] The \fBct_state\fR capability must be true for this to make sense\[char46]
.IP
If false, Open vSwitch will reject flows that match on the \fBsnat\fR or \fBdnat\fR bits in \fBct_state\fR or use \fBnat\fR in the \fBct\fR action\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_zone\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_ZONE\[char46] If false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on the \fBct_zone\fR field or that specify a nonzero zone or a zone field on the \fBct\fR action\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_mark\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_MARK\[char46] If false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on the \fBct_mark\fR field or that set \fBct_mark\fR in the \fBct\fR action\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_label\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_LABEL\[char46] If false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on the \fBct_label\fR field or that set \fBct_label\fR in the \fBct\fR action\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_orig_tuple\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, the datapath supports matching the 5-tuple from the connection\(cqs original direction for IPv4 traffic\[char46] If false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on \fBct_nw_src\fR or \fBct_nw_dst\fR, that use the \fBct\fR feature of the \fBresubmit\fR action, or the \fBforce\fR keyword in the \fBct\fR action\[char46] (The latter isn\(cqt tied to connection tracking support of original tuples in any technical way\[char46] They are conflated because all current datapaths implemented the two features at the same time\[char46])
.IP
If this and \fBcapabilities:ct_orig_tuple6\fR are both false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on \fBct_nw_proto\fR, \fBct_tp_src\fR, or \fBct_tp_dst\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_orig_tuple6\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
If true, the datapath supports matching the 5-tuple from the connection\(cqs original direction for IPv6 traffic\[char46] If false, Open vSwitch rejects flows that match on \fBct_ipv6_src\fR or \fBct_ipv6_dst\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : masked_set_action\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports masked data in OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SET actions\[char46] Masked data can improve performance by allowing megaflows to match on fewer fields\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : tnl_push_pop\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports tnl_push and pop actions\[char46] This is a prerequisite for a datapath to support native tunneling\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ufid\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_FLOW_ATTR_UFID\[char46] UFID support improves revalidation performance by transferring less data between the slow path and the datapath\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : trunc\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_TRUNC action\[char46] If false, the \fBoutput\fR action with packet truncation requires every packet to be sent to the Open vSwitch slow path, which is likely to make it too slow for mirroring traffic in bulk\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : nd_ext\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_ND_EXTENSIONS to match on ICMPv6 \(dqND reserved\(dq and \(dqND option type\(dq header fields\[char46] If false, the datapath reports error if the feature is used\[char46]
.ST "Clone Actions:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
When Open vSwitch translates actions from OpenFlow into the datapath representation, some of the datapath actions may modify the packet or have other side effects that later datapath actions can\(cqt undo\[char46] The OpenFlow \fBct\fR, \fBmeter\fR, \fBoutput\fR with truncation, \fBencap\fR, \fBdecap\fR, and \fBdec_nsh_ttl\fR actions fall into this category\[char46] Often, this is not a problem because nothing later on needs the original packet\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Such actions can, however, occur in circumstances where the translation does require the original packet\[char46] For example, an OpenFlow \fBoutput\fR action might direct a packet to a patch port, which might in turn lead to a \fBct\fR action that NATs the packet (which cannot be undone), and then afterward when control flow pops back across the patch port some other action might need to act on the original packet\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Open vSwitch has two different ways to implement this ``save and restore\(cq\(cq via datapath actions\[char46] These capabilities indicate which one Open vSwitch will choose\[char46] When neither is available, Open vSwitch simply fails in situations that require this feature\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : clone\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE action\[char46] This is the preferred option for saving and restoring packets, since it is intended for the purpose, but old datapaths do not support it\[char46] Open vSwitch will use it whenever it is available\[char46]
.IP
(The OpenFlow \fBclone\fR action does not always yield a OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE action\[char46] It only does so when the datapath supports it and the \fBclone\fR brackets actions that otherwise cannot be undone\[char46])
.IP "\fBcapabilities : sample_nesting\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Maximum level of nesting allowed by OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SAMPLE action\[char46] Open vSwitch misuses this action for saving and restoring packets when the datapath supports more than 3 levels of nesting and OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE is not available\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_eventmask\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath\(cqs OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT action implements the OVS_CT_ATTR_EVENTMASK attribute\[char46] When this is true, Open vSwitch uses the event mask feature to limit the kinds of events reported to conntrack update listeners\[char46] When Open vSwitch doesn\(cqt limit the event mask, listeners receive reports of numerous usually unimportant events, such as TCP state machine changes, which can waste CPU time\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_clear\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT_CLEAR action\[char46] If false, the OpenFlow \fBct_clear\fR action has no effect on the datapath\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : max_hash_alg\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Highest supported dp_hash algorithm\[char46] This allows Open vSwitch to avoid requesting a packet hash that the datapath does not support\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : check_pkt_len\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CHECK_PKT_LEN\[char46] If false, Open vSwitch implements the \fBcheck_pkt_larger\fR action by sending every packet through the Open vSwitch slow path, which is likely to make it too slow for handling traffic in bulk\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_timeout\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_CT_ATTR_TIMEOUT in the OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT action\[char46] If false, Open vswitch cannot implement timeout policies based on connection tracking zones, as configured through the \fBCT_Timeout_Policy\fR table\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : explicit_drop_action\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_DROP\[char46] If false, explicit drop action will not be sent to the datapath\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_zero_snat\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports all-zero SNAT\[char46] This is a special case if the \fBsrc\fR IP address is configured as all 0\(cqs, i\[char46]e\[char46], \fBnat(src=0\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]0)\fR\[char46] In this case, when a source port collision is detected during the commit, the source port will be translated to an ephemeral port\[char46] If there is no collision, no SNAT is performed\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : ct_flush\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports CT flush OpenFlow Nicira extension called \fBNXT_CT_FLUSH\fR\[char46] The \fBNXT_CT_FLUSH\fR extensions allows to flush CT entries based on specified parameters\[char46]
.IP "\fBcapabilities : psample\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PSAMPLE\[char46] If false, local sampling will not be supported with the Linux kernel datapath\[char46]
.IP "\fBct_zone_default_limit\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295"
Default connection tracking zone limit that is applied to all zones that didn\(cqt specify the \fBlimit\fR explicitly\[char46] If the limit is unspecified the default limit configuration for the datapath is left intact\[char46] The value 0 means unlimited\[char46]

Configuration for sending packets to IPFIX collectors\[char46]

IPFIX is a protocol that exports a number of details about flows\[char46] The IPFIX implementation in Open vSwitch samples packets at a configurable rate, extracts flow information from those packets, optionally caches and aggregates the flow information, and sends the result to one or more collectors\[char46]
.PP
.PP
IPFIX in Open vSwitch can be configured two different ways:
.RS
.IP \(bu
With \fBper\-bridge sampling\fR, Open vSwitch performs IPFIX sampling automatically on all packets that pass through a bridge\[char46] To configure per-bridge sampling, create an \fBIPFIX\fR record and point a \fBBridge\fR table\(cqs \fBipfix\fR column to it\[char46] The \fBFlow_Sample_Collector_Set\fR table is not used for per-bridge sampling\[char46]

Flow-based sampling also requires database configuration: create a \fBIPFIX\fR record that describes the IPFIX configuration and a \fBFlow_Sample_Collector_Set\fR record that points to the \fBBridge\fR whose flow table holds the \fBsample\fR actions and to \fBIPFIX\fR record\[char46] The \fBipfix\fR in the \fBBridge\fR table is not used for flow-based sampling\[char46]

Auto Attach configuration within a bridge\[char46] The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard describes a compact method of using IEEE 802\[char46]1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE 802\[char46]1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices to individual services in a SPB network\[char46] The intent here is to allow network applications and devices using OVS to be able to easily take advantage of features offered by industry standard SPB networks\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Auto Attach (AA) uses LLDP to communicate between a directly connected Auto Attach Client (AAC) and Auto Attach Server (AAS)\[char46] The LLDP protocol is extended to add two new Type-Length-Value tuples (TLVs)\[char46] The first new TLV supports the ongoing discovery of directly connected AA correspondents\[char46] Auto Attach operates by regularly transmitting AA discovery TLVs between the AA client and AA server\[char46] By exchanging these discovery messages, both the AAC and AAS learn the system name and system description of their peer\[char46] In the OVS context, OVS operates as the AA client and the AA server resides on a switch at the edge of the SPB network\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Once AA discovery has been completed the AAC then uses the second new TLV to deliver identifier mappings from the AAC to the AAS\[char46] A primary feature of Auto Attach is to facilitate the mapping of VLANs defined outside the SPB network onto service ids (ISIDs) defined within the SPM network\[char46] By doing so individual external VLANs can be mapped onto specific SPB network services\[char46] These VLAN id to ISID mappings can be configured and managed locally using new options added to the ovs-vsctl command\[char46]
.PP

The Auto Attach OVS feature does not provide a full implementation of the LLDP protocol\[char46] Support for the mandatory TLVs as defined by the LLDP standard and support for the AA TLV extensions is provided\[char46] LLDP protocol support in OVS can be enabled or disabled on a port by port basis\[char46] LLDP support is disabled by default\[char46]
