.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46] The CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database\[char46] The \fBovn\-northd\fR program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]

We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port\[char46] Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single fixed Ethernet address\[char46]

When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose destination MAC address is in a logical port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it only to that port, as if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the port\[char46]

If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates that the logical port owns the given IP addresses\[char46]

If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without traversing the physical network\[char46] The OVN logical router connected to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports\[char46]

Association of one or more chassis to a logical router port\[char46] The traffic going out through an specific router port will be redirected to a chassis, or a set of them in high availability configurations\[char46] A single \fBGateway_Chassis\fR is equivalent to setting \fBoptions:redirect-chassis\fR\[char46] Using \fBGateway_Chassis\fR allows associating multiple prioritized chassis with a single logical router port\[char46]

A suggested, but not required naming convention is \fB${port_name}_${chassis_name}\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBchassis_name\fR: string"
Name of the chassis that we want to redirect traffic through for the associated logical router port\[char46] The value must match the \fBname\fR column of the \fBChassis\fR table in the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]
.IP "\fBpriority\fR: integer, in range 0 to 32,767"
This is the priority of a chassis among all \fBGateway_Chassis\fR belonging to the same logical router port\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions\fR: map of string-string pairs"
