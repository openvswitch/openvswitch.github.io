.PP
.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46] The CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database\[char46] The \fBovn\-northd\fR program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]

We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]

Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46] This column has the same form and purpose each place it appears\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container\[char46] OVN can use VLAN tags to support such cases\[char46] Each container is assigned a VLAN ID and each packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the appropriate ID for the container\[char46] Such VLAN IDs never appear on a physical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except relative to a single VM on a hypervisor\[char46]

Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
.RS
.TP
\fBEthernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both)\fR
An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port\[char46] Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single fixed Ethernet address\[char46]
.IP
When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose destination MAC address is in a logical port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it only to that port, as if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the port\[char46]
.IP
If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates that the logical port owns the given IP addresses\[char46]
.IP
If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without traversing the physical network\[char46] The OVN logical router connected to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports\[char46]

Note that the order here is important\[char46] The Ethernet address must be listed before the IP address(es) if defined\[char46]

\fBEthernet address followed by keyword \(dqdynamic\(dq\fR

\fB80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 dynamic\fR

A name for the logical router port\[char46]
.IP
In addition to provide convenience for human interaction with the northbound database, this column is used as reference by its patch port in \fBLogical_Switch_Port\fR or another logical router port in \fBLogical_Router_Port\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBgateway_chassis\fR: set of \fBGateway_Chassis\fRs"
If set, this indicates that this logical router port represents a distributed gateway port that connects this router to a logical switch with a localnet port\[char46] There may be at most one such logical router port on each logical router\[char46]
.IP
Several \fBGateway_Chassis\fR can be referenced for a given logical router port\[char46] A single \fBGateway_Chassis\fR is functionally equivalent to setting \fBoptions:redirect-chassis\fR\[char46] Refer to the description of \fBoptions:redirect-chassis\fR for additional details on gateway handling\[char46]
.IP
Defining more than one \fBGateway_Chassis\fR will enable gateway high availability\[char46] Only one gateway will be active at a time\[char46] OVN chassis will use BFD to monitor connectivity to a gateway\[char46] If connectivity to the active gateway is interrupted, another gateway will become active\[char46] The \fBpriority\fR column specifies the order that gateways will be chosen by OVN\[char46]

The IP addresses and netmasks of the router\[char46] For example, \fB192\[char46]168\[char46]0\[char46]1/24\fR indicates that the router\(cqs IP address is 192\[char46]168\[char46]0\[char46]1 and that packets destined to 192\[char46]168\[char46]0\[char46]\fIx\fR should be routed to this port\[char46]

A logical router port always adds a link-local IPv6 address (fe80::/64) automatically generated from the interface\(cqs MAC address using the modified EUI\-64 format\[char46]
.IP "\fBmac\fR: string"

This column is used to administratively set port state\[char46] If this column is empty or is set to \fBtrue\fR, the port is enabled\[char46] If this column is set to \fBfalse\fR, the port is disabled\[char46] A disabled port has all ingress and egress traffic dropped\[char46]

The recommended MTU for the link\[char46] Default is 0, which means no MTU Option will be included in RA packet replied by ovn-controller\[char46] Per RFC 2460, the mtu value is recommended no less than 1280, so any mtu value less than 1280 will be considered as no MTU Option\[char46]
.IP "\fBipv6_ra_configs : send_periodic\fR: optional string"
If set to true, then this router interface will send router advertisements periodically\[char46] The default is false\[char46]
.IP "\fBipv6_ra_configs : max_interval\fR: optional string"

Additional options for the logical router port\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : redirect-chassis\fR: optional string"
If set, this indicates that this logical router port represents a distributed gateway port that connects this router to a logical switch with a localnet port\[char46] There may be at most one such logical router port on each logical router\[char46]
.IP
Even when a \fBredirect\-chassis\fR is specified, the logical router port still effectively resides on each chassis\[char46] However, due to the implications of the use of L2 learning in the physical network, as well as the need to support advanced features such as one-to-many NAT (aka IP masquerading), a subset of the logical router processing is handled in a centralized manner on the specified \fBredirect\-chassis\fR\[char46]
.IP
When this option is specified, the peer logical switch port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR must be set to \fBrouter\fR\[char46] With this setting, the \fBexternal_mac\fRs specified in NAT rules are automatically programmed in the peer logical switch\(cqs destination lookup on the chassis where the \fBlogical_port\fR resides\[char46] In addition, the logical router\(cqs MAC address is automatically programmed in the peer logical switch\(cqs destination lookup flow on the \fBredirect\-chassis\fR\[char46]
.IP
When this option is specified and it is desired to generate gratuitous ARPs for NAT addresses, then the peer logical switch port\(cqs \fBoptions:nat-addresses\fR should be set to \fBrouter\fR\[char46]
.IP
While \fBoptions:redirect-chassis\fR is still supported for backwards compatibility, it is now preferred to specify one or more \fBgateway_chassis\fR instead\[char46] It is functionally equivalent, but allows you to specify multiple chassis to enable high availability\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : reside-on-redirect-chassis\fR: optional string"
Generally routing is distributed in \fBOVN\fR\[char46] The packet from a logical port which needs to be routed hits the router pipeline in the source chassis\[char46] For the East-West traffic, the packet is sent directly to the destination chassis\[char46] For the outside traffic the packet is sent to the gateway chassis\[char46]

.IP \(bu
The logical router to which this logical router port belongs to has a distributed gateway port\[char46]
.IP \(bu
The peer\(cqs logical switch has a localnet port (representing a VLAN tagged network)
.RE
.IP
When this option is set to \fBtrue\fR, then the packet which needs to be routed hits the router pipeline in the chassis hosting the distributed gateway router port\[char46] The source chassis pushes out this traffic via the localnet port\[char46] With this the East-West traffic is no more distributed and will always go through the gateway chassis\[char46]
.IP
Without this option set, for any traffic destined to outside from a logical port which belongs to a logical switch with localnet port, the source chassis will send the traffic to the gateway chassis via the tunnel port instead of the localnet port and this could cause MTU issues\[char46]
