.SH NAME
ovn-nb \- OVN_Northbound database schema
.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
(CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46]  The CMS produces almost all of
the contents of the database\[char46]  The \fBovn\-northd\fR program
monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]
.PP
We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]
.SS "External IDs"
.PP
Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named
\fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46]  This column has the same form and purpose each
place it appears\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by the CMS\[char46]  The CMS might use certain pairs, for
example, to identify entities in its own configuration that correspond to
those in this database\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

.ST "VMI (or VIF) Options:"
These options apply to logical ports with \fBtype\fR having

in bit/s\[char46] The traffic will be shaped according to this limit\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : qos_burst\fR: optional string"
If set, indicates the maximum burst size for data sent from this

.ST "Containers:"
When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too
expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container\[char46]  OVN can use VLAN tags
to support such cases\[char46]  Each container is assigned a VLAN ID and each
packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the
appropriate ID for the container\[char46]  Such VLAN IDs never appear on a
physical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except
relative to a single VM on a hypervisor\[char46]
.PP
These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers using
shared VIFs\[char46]  For VMs and for containers that have dedicated VIFs, they
are empty\[char46]
.IP "\fBparent_name\fR: optional string"
The VM interface through which the nested container sends its network
traffic\[char46]  This must match the \fBname\fR column for some
other \fBLogical_Switch_Port\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBtag_request\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
The VLAN tag in the network traffic associated with a container\(cqs
network interface\[char46]  The client can request \fBovn\-northd\fR
to allocate a tag that is unique within the scope of a specific
parent (specified in \fBparent_name\fR) by setting a value
of \fB0\fR in this column\[char46]  The allocated value is written
by \fBovn\-northd\fR in the \fBtag\fR column\[char46]
(Note that these tags are allocated and managed locally in
\fBovn\-northd\fR, so they cannot be reconstructed in the event
that the database is lost\[char46])  The client can also request a specific
non-zero tag and \fBovn\-northd\fR will honor it and copy that
value to the \fBtag\fR column\[char46]
.IP
When \fBtype\fR is set to \fBlocalnet\fR or
\fBl2gateway\fR, this can
be set to indicate that the port represents a connection to a
specific VLAN on a locally accessible network\[char46] The VLAN ID is used
to match incoming traffic and is also added to outgoing traffic\[char46]
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
The VLAN tag allocated by \fBovn\-northd\fR based on the
contents of the \fBtag_request\fR column\[char46]
.ST "Port State:"
.IP "\fBup\fR: optional boolean"
This column is populated by \fBovn\-northd\fR, rather than by the
CMS plugin as is most of this database\[char46]  When a logical port is bound
to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database \fBBinding\fR table, \fBovn\-northd\fR
sets this column to \fBtrue\fR; otherwise, or if the port
becomes unbound later, it sets it to \fBfalse\fR\[char46]  This allows
the CMS to wait for a VM\(cqs (or container\(cqs) networking to become active
before it allows the VM (or container) to start\[char46]
.IP "\fBenabled\fR: optional boolean"
This column is used to administratively set port state\[char46]  If this column
is empty or is set to \fBtrue\fR, the port is enabled\[char46]  If this
column is set to \fBfalse\fR, the port is disabled\[char46]  A disabled
port has all ingress and egress traffic dropped\[char46]
.ST "Addressing:"
.IP "\fBaddresses\fR: set of strings"
Addresses owned by the logical port\[char46]
.IP
Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
.RS
.TP
\fBEthernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both)\fR
An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port\[char46]
Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has
a single fixed Ethernet address\[char46]
.IP
When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame
whose destination MAC address is in a logical port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it only to that port, as
if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the
port\[char46]
.IP
If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates
that the logical port owns the given IP addresses\[char46]
.IP
If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this
information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without
traversing the physical network\[char46] The OVN logical router connected
to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid
issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports\[char46]
.IP
Note that the order here is important\[char46] The Ethernet address must
be listed before the IP address(es) if defined\[char46]
.IP
Examples:
.RS

.TP
\fB80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41\fR

This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and
1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 address\[char46]
.RE
.TP
\fBunknown\fR
This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet
addresses\[char46]  When an OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet
frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port\(cqs
\fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it to the port (or
ports) whose \fBaddresses\fR columns include
\fBunknown\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBdynamic\fR
Use this keyword to make \fBovn\-northd\fR generate a
globally unique MAC address and choose an unused IPv4 address with
the logical port\(cqs subnet and store them in the port\(cqs \fBdynamic_addresses\fR column\[char46]  \fBovn\-northd\fR will
use the subnet specified in \fBother_config:subnet\fR in the port\(cqs \fBLogical_Switch\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBEthernet address followed by keyword \(dqdynamic\(dq\fR
The keyword \fBdynamic\fR after the MAC address indicates
that \fBovn\-northd\fR should choose an unused IPv4 address
from the logical port\(cqs subnet and store it with the specified
MAC in the port\(cqs \fBdynamic_addresses\fR column\[char46]
\fBovn\-northd\fR will use the subnet specified in \fBother_config:subnet\fR in
the port\(cqs \fBLogical_Switch\fR table\[char46]

Examples:
.RS
.TP
\fB80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 dynamic\fR
This indicates that the logical port owns the specified

unused IPv4 address for the logical port from the corresponding
logical switch subnet\[char46]
.RE
.RE
.IP "\fBdynamic_addresses\fR: optional string"
Addresses assigned to the logical port by \fBovn\-northd\fR, if
\fBdynamic\fR is specified in \fBaddresses\fR\[char46]
Addresses will be of the same format as those that populate the \fBaddresses\fR column\[char46]  Note that dynamically assigned
addresses are constructed and managed locally in ovn-northd, so they
cannot be reconstructed in the event that the database is lost\[char46]
.IP "\fBport_security\fR: set of strings"
This column controls the addresses from which the host attached to the
logical port (``the host\(cq\(cq) is allowed to send packets and to which it
is allowed to receive packets\[char46]  If this column is empty, all addresses
are permitted\[char46]

Each element in the set must begin with one Ethernet address\[char46]
This would restrict the host to sending packets from and receiving

must be a CIDR mask\[char46]  In addition to the restrictions described for
Ethernet addresses above, such an element restricts the IPv4 or IPv6
addresses from which the host may send and to which it may receive
packets to the specified addresses\[char46]  A masked address, if the host part
is zero, indicates that the host is allowed to use any address in the
subnet; if the host part is nonzero, the mask simply indicates the size
of the subnet\[char46] In addition:
