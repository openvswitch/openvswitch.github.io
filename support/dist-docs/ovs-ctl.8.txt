DESCRIPTION
       The  ovs-ctl  program  starts,  stops,  and  checks  the status of Open
       vSwitch daemons.  It is not meant to be invoked directly by system  ad‐
       ministrators but to be called internally by system startup scripts.

       Each ovs-ctl command is described separately below.

   The start command
       The  start  command  starts  Open  vSwitch.   It performs the following
       tasks:

       1. Loads the Open vSwitch kernel module.  If this fails, and the  Linux
          bridge module is loaded but no bridges exist, it tries to unload the
          bridge  module  and  tries  loading  the  Open vSwitch kernel module
          again.  (This is because the Open vSwitch kernel module cannot coex‐
          ist with the Linux bridge module before 2.6.37.)

       The start command skips the following steps if ovsdb-server is  already
       running:

       2. If the Open vSwitch database file does not exist, it creates it.  If
          the database does exist, but it has an obsolete version, it upgrades
          it to the latest schema.

       3. Starts  ovsdb-server, unless the --no-ovsdb-server command option is
          given.

       4. Initializes a few values inside the database.

       5. If the --delete-bridges option was used, deletes all of the  bridges
          from the database.

       6. If  the  --delete-transient-ports option was used, deletes all ports
          that have other_config:transient set to true.

       The start command skips the following step if ovs-vswitchd  is  already
       running, or if the --no-ovs-vswitchd command option is given:

       7. Starts ovs-vswitchd.

   Options
       Several  command-line  options  influence the start command’s behavior.
       Some form of the following option should ordinarily be specified:

       • --system-id=<uuid> or --system-id=random

         This specifies a  unique  system  identifier  to  store  into  exter‐
         nal-ids:system-id  in the database’s Open_vSwitch table.  Remote man‐
         agers that talk to the Open vSwitch database server over network pro‐
         tocols use this value to identify and distinguish  Open  vSwitch  in‐
         stances,  so it should be unique (at least) within OVS instances that
         will connect to a single controller.

         When random is specified, ovs-ctl will generate a random ID that per‐
         sists from one run to another  (stored  in  a  file).   When  another
         string is specified ovs-ctl uses it literally.

       The following options should be specified if the defaults are not suit‐
       able:

       • --system-type=<type> or --system-version=<version>

         Sets  the  value  to  store  in  the  system-type  and system-version
         columns, respectively, in the database’s Open_vSwitch table.   Remote
         managers  may  use  these  values too determine the kind of system to
         which they are connected (primarily for display to human  administra‐
         tors).

         When  not  specified,  ovs-ctl  uses  values  from  the optional sys‐
         tem-type.conf and system-version.conf files (see Files)  or  it  uses
         the lsb_release program, if present, to provide reasonable defaults.

       The following options are also likely to be useful:

       • --external-id="<name>=<value>"

         Sets  external-ids:<name>  to  <value> in the database’s Open_vSwitch
         table.  Specifying this option multiple times adds multiple key-value
         pairs.

       • --delete-bridges

         Ordinarily Open vSwitch bridges persist from one system boot  to  the
         next,  as  long  as the database is preserved.  Some environments in‐
         stead expect to re-create all of the bridges and other  configuration
         state on every boot.  This option supports that, by deleting all Open
         vSwitch  bridges  after  starting  ovsdb-server  but  before starting
         ovs-vswitchd.

       • --delete-transient-ports

         Deletes all ports that have other_config:transient set to true.  This
         is important on certain environments where some ports are going to be
         recreated after reboot, but other ports need to be persisted  in  the
         database.

       • --ovs-user=user[:group]

         Ordinarily  Open vSwitch daemons are started as the user invoking the
         ovs-ctl command.  Some system administrators would prefer to have the
         various daemons spawn as different users in their environments.  This
         option allows passing the  --user  option  to  the  ovsdb-server  and
         ovs-vswitchd daemons, allowing them to change their privilege levels.

       The following options are less important:

       • --no-monitor

         By default ovs-ctl passes --monitor to ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server,
         requesting  that  it  spawn  a process monitor which will restart the
         daemon if it crashes.  This option suppresses that behavior.

       • --daemon-cwd=<directory>

         Specifies the current working directory that the OVS  daemons  should
         run  from.   The  default is / (the root directory) if this option is
         not specified.  (This option is useful because  most  systems  create
         core  files  in  a  process’s current working directory and because a
         file system that is in use as a process’s current  working  directory
         cannot be unmounted.)

       • --no-force-corefiles

         By default, ovs-ctl enables core dumps for the OVS daemons.  This op‐
         tion disables that behavior.

       • --no-mlockall

         By default ovs-ctl passes --mlockall to ovs-vswitchd, requesting that
         it  lock all of its virtual memory on page fault (on allocation, when
         running on Linux kernel 4.4 and  older),  preventing  it  from  being
         paged to disk.  This option suppresses that behavior.

       • --no-self-confinement

         Disable  self-confinement  for ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server daemons.
         This flag may be used when, for example, OpenFlow controller  creates
         its  Unix  Domain  Socket  outside OVS run directory and OVS needs to
         connect to it.  It is better to stick with the default  behavior  and
         not to use this flag, unless:

         • You  have  Open vSwitch running under SELinux or AppArmor Mandatory
           Access Control that would prevent OVS  from  messing  with  sockets
           outside ordinary OVS directories.

         • You  believe that relying on protocol handshakes (e.g. OpenFlow) is
           enough to prevent OVS to adversely interact with other daemons run‐
           ning on your system.

         • You don’t have much worries of remote OVSDB exploits in  the  first
           place,  because, perhaps, OVSDB manager is running on the same host
           as OVS and share similar attack vectors.

       • --oom-score=<score>

         Sets the Linux Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer score for  the  OVS  daemon
         after it’s been started.

       • --ulimit-core=<LIMIT>

         Sets  ulimit  core  file  size  for  the  OVS  daemon after it’s been
         started.

       • --ovsdb-server-priority=<niceness> or  --ovs-vswitchd-priority=<nice‐
         ness>

         Sets  the nice(1) level used for each daemon.  All of them default to
         -10.

       • --ovsdb-server-wrapper=<wrapper> or --ovs-vswitchd-wrapper=<wrapper>

         Configures the specified daemon to run under <wrapper>, which is  one
         of the following:

         • valgrind:  Run  the  daemon  under valgrind(1), if it is installed,
           logging to <daemon>.valgrind.log.<pid> in the log directory.

         • strace: Run the daemon under strace(1), if it is installed, logging
           to <daemon>.strace.log.<pid> in the log directory.

         • glibc: Enable GNU C library features designed to  find  memory  er‐
           rors.

         By default, no wrapper is used.

         Each of the wrappers can expose bugs in Open vSwitch that lead to in‐
         correct  operation, including crashes.  The valgrind and strace wrap‐
         pers greatly slow daemon operations so they should  not  be  used  in
         production.   They also produce voluminous logs that can quickly fill
         small disk partitions.  The glibc wrapper is less  resource-intensive
         but still somewhat slows the daemons.

       The following options control file locations.  They should only be used
       if  the  default  locations cannot be used.  See FILES, below, for more
       information.

       • --db-file=<file>

         Overrides the file name for the OVS database.

       • --db-sock=<socket>

         Overrides the file name for the Unix domain socket used to connect to
         ovsdb-server.

       • --db-schema=<schema>

         Overrides the file name for the OVS database schema.

       • --extra-dbs=<file>

         Adds <file> as an extra database for ovsdb-server to serve out.  Mul‐
         tiple space-separated file  names  may  also  be  specified.   <file>
         should  begin  with /; if it does not, then it will be taken as rela‐
         tive to <dbdir>.

   The stop command
       The stop command stops the ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server  daemons.   It
       does  not  unload the Open vSwitch kernel modules. It can take the same
       --no-ovsdb-server and --no-ovs-vswitchd options as that  of  the  start
       command.

       This  command does nothing and finishes successfully if the OVS daemons
       aren’t running.

   The restart command
       The restart command performs a stop followed by a start  command.   The
       command  can take the same options as that of the start command. In ad‐
       dition, it saves  and  restores  OpenFlow  flows  for  each  individual
       bridge.

   The status command
       The  status  command  checks  whether  the OVS daemons ovs-vswitchd and
       ovsdb-server are running and prints messages with that information.  It
       exits with status 0 if the daemons are running, 1 otherwise.

   The version command
       The version command runs ovsdb-server --version and ovs-vswitchd --ver‐
       sion.

   The force-reload-kmod command
       The force-reload-kmod command allows upgrading the Open vSwitch  kernel
       module without rebooting.  It performs the following tasks:

       1. Gets  a  list of OVS “internal” interfaces, that is, network devices
          implemented by Open vSwitch.  The most common examples of these  are
          bridge “local ports”.

       2. Saves the OpenFlow flows of each bridge.

       3. Stops the Open vSwitch daemons, as if by a call to ovs-ctl stop.

       4. Saves  the kernel configuration state of the OVS internal interfaces
          listed in step 1, including IP and IPv6 addresses and routing  table
          entries.

       5. Unloads the Open vSwitch kernel module (including the bridge compat‐
          ibility module if it is loaded).

       6. Starts  OVS back up, as if by a call to ovs-ctl start.  This reloads
          the kernel module, restarts the OVS daemons and finally restores the
          saved OpenFlow flows.

       7. Restores the kernel configuration state that was saved in step 4.

       8. Checks for daemons that may need to be restarted because  they  have
          packet  sockets  that are listening on old instances of Open vSwitch
          kernel interfaces and, if it finds any, prints a warning on  stdout.
          DHCP  is  a  common example: if the ISC DHCP client is running on an
          OVS internal interface, then it will have to be restarted after com‐
          pleting the above procedure.  (It would be  nice  if  ovs-ctl  could
          restart  daemons automatically, but the details are far too specific
          to a particular distribution and installation.)

       force-kmod-reload internally stops and starts OVS, so it accepts all of
       the  options  accepted  by   the   start   command   except   for   the
       --no-ovs-vswitchd option.

   The load-kmod command
       The  load-kmod command loads the openvswitch kernel modules if they are
       not already loaded.  This operation also occurs as part  of  the  start
       command.   The motivation for providing the load-kmod command is to al‐
       low errors when loading modules to be handled separately from other er‐
       rors that may occur when running the start command.

       By default the load-kmod command attempts to load the openvswitch  ker‐
       nel module.

   The enable-protocol command
       The  enable-protocol  command  checks  for rules related to a specified
       protocol in the system’s iptables(8) configuration.  If  there  are  no
       rules  specifically related to that protocol, then it inserts a rule to
       accept the specified protocol.

       More specifically:

       • If iptables is not installed or not enabled, this command does  noth‐
         ing,  assuming  that lack of filtering means that the protocol is en‐
         abled.

       • If the INPUT chain has a rule that matches  the  specified  protocol,
         then  this  command  does nothing, assuming that whatever rule is in‐
         stalled reflects the system administrator’s decisions.

       • Otherwise, this command installs a rule that accepts traffic  of  the
         specified protocol.

       This  command normally completes successfully, even if it does nothing.
       Only the failure of an attempt to insert a rule normally causes  it  to
       return an exit code other than 0.

       The following options control the protocol to be enabled:

       • --protocol=<protocol>

         The  name  of the IP protocol to be enabled, such as gre or tcp.  The
         default is gre.

       • --sport=<sport> or --dport=<dport>

         TCP or UDP source or destination port to match.  These  are  optional
         and allowed only with --protocol=tcp or --protocol=udp.

   The delete-transient-ports command
       Deletes  all  ports  that  have the other_config:transient value set to
       true.

   The help command
       Prints a usage message and exits successfully.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options listed for each command above, these options
       control the behavior of several ovs-ctl commands.

       By default, ovs-ctl controls the ovsdb-server and ovs-vswitchd daemons.
       The following options restrict that  control  to  exclude  one  or  the
       other:

       • --no-ovsdb-server

         Specifies  that  the ovs-ctl commands start, stop, and restart should
         not modify the running status of ovsdb-server.

       • --no-ovs-vswitchd

         Specifies that the ovs-ctl commands start, stop, and  restart  should
         not modify the running status of ovs-vswitchd.  It is an error to in‐
         clude this option with the force-reload-kmod command.

EXIT STATUS
       ovs-ctl  exits  with  status  0 on success and nonzero on failure.  The
       start command is considered to succeed if OVS is already  started;  the
       stop command is considered to succeed if OVS is already stopped.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables affect ovs-ctl:

       • PATH

         ovs-ctl does not hardcode the location of any of the programs that it
         runs.   ovs-ctl  will add the <sbindir> and <bindir> that were speci‐
         fied at configure time to PATH, if they are not already present.

       • OVS_LOGDIR, OVS_RUNDIR,  OVS_DBDIR,  OVS_SYSCONFDIR,  OVS_PKGDATADIR,
         OVS_BINDIR, OVS_SBINDIR

         Setting  one  of these variables in the environment overrides the re‐
         spective configure option, both for ovs-ctl itself and for the  other
         Open vSwitch programs that it runs.

FILES
       ovs-ctl uses the following files:

       • ovs-lib

         Shell  function  library  used internally by ovs-ctl.  It must be in‐
         stalled in the same directory as ovs-ctl.

       • <logdir>/<daemon>.log

         Per-daemon logfiles.

       • <rundir>/<daemon>.pid

         Per-daemon pidfiles to track whether a daemon  is  running  and  with
         what process ID.

       • <pkgdatadir>/vswitch.ovsschema

         The  OVS  database  schema  used  to  initialize  the  database  (use
         --db-schema to override this location).

       • <dbdir>/conf.db

         The OVS database (use --db-file to override this location).

       • <rundir>/openvswitch/db.sock

         The Unix domain socket used for local communication with ovsdb-server
         (use --db-sock to override this location).

       • <sysconfdir>/openvswitch/system-id.conf

         The persistent system UUID created and read by --system-id=random.

       • <sysconfdir>/openvswitch/system-type.conf   and    <sysconfdir>/open‐
         vswitch/system-version.conf

         The  system-type  and  system-version values stored in the database’s
         Open_vSwitch table when not specified as a command-line option.

EXAMPLE
       The file debian/openvswitch-switch.init in the Open vSwitch source dis‐
       tribution is a good example of how to use ovs-ctl.
