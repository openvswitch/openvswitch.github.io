This database is for local configuration of an ovsdb-server\[char46] The database is meant to be unique, even among multiple clustered db servers, so that configuration that is local to that server can be configured separately (e\[char46]g\[char46] Connection information)\[char46]
.SH "TABLE SUMMARY"

Connection methods for clients\[char46]
.IP
The following connection methods are currently supported:
.RS
.TP
\fBssl:\fIhost\fB\fR[\fB:\fIport\fB\fR]
The specified SSL/TLS \fIport\fR on the host at the given \fIhost\fR, which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an IP address\[char46] A valid SSL/TLS configuration must be provided when this form is used, this configuration can be specified via command-line options or the \fBSSL\fR table\[char46]
.IP
If \fIport\fR is not specified, it defaults to 6640\[char46]
.IP
SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always built as part of Open vSwitch\[char46]
.TP
\fBtcp:\fIhost\fB\fR[\fB:\fIport\fB\fR]
The specified TCP \fIport\fR on the host at the given \fIhost\fR, which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an IP address\[char46] If \fIhost\fR is an IPv6 address, wrap it in square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBtcp:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46]
.IP
If \fIport\fR is not specified, it defaults to 6640\[char46]
.TP
\fBpssl:\fR[\fIport\fR][\fB:\fIhost\fB\fR]
Listens for SSL/TLS connections on the specified TCP \fIport\fR\[char46] Specify 0 for \fIport\fR to have the kernel automatically choose an available port\[char46] If \fIhost\fR, which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound library) or an IP address, is specified, then connections are restricted to the resolved or specified local IPaddress (either IPv4 or IPv6 address)\[char46] If \fIhost\fR is an IPv6 address, wrap in square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBpssl:6640:[::1]\fR\[char46] If \fIhost\fR is not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) addresses\[char46] A valid SSL/TLS configuration must be provided when this form is used, this can be specified either via command-line options or the \fBSSL\fR table\[char46]

If \fIport\fR is not specified, it defaults to 6640\[char46]
.RE
.IP
When multiple clients are configured, the \fBtarget\fR values must be unique\[char46] Duplicate \fBtarget\fR values yield unspecified results\[char46]
.IP "\fBread_only\fR: boolean"
\fBtrue\fR to restrict these connections to read-only transactions, \fBfalse\fR to allow them to modify the database\[char46]
.IP "\fBrole\fR: string"
String containing role name for this connection entry\[char46]
.ST "Client Failure Detection and Handling:"
.PP
.IP "\fBmax_backoff\fR: optional integer, at least 1,000"
Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection attempts\[char46] Default is implementation-specific\[char46]
.IP "\fBinactivity_probe\fR: optional integer"
Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the client before sending an inactivity probe message\[char46] If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the client for the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe\[char46] If a response is not received for the same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect\[char46] Default is implementation-specific\[char46] A value of 0 disables inactivity probes\[char46]
.ST "Status:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
Key-value pair of \fBis_connected\fR is always updated\[char46] Other key-value pairs in the status columns may be updated depends on the \fBtarget\fR type\[char46]

.PP
When \fBtarget\fR specifies a connection method that listens for inbound connections (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBptcp:\fR or \fBpunix:\fR), both \fBn_connections\fR and \fBis_connected\fR may also be updated while the remaining key-value pairs are omitted\[char46]
.PP
.PP
On the other hand, when \fBtarget\fR specifies an outbound connection, all key-value pairs may be updated, except the above-mentioned two key-value pairs associated with inbound connection targets\[char46] They are omitted\[char46]
.IP "\fBis_connected\fR: boolean"
\fBtrue\fR if currently connected to this client, \fBfalse\fR otherwise\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : last_error\fR: optional string"
A human-readable description of the last error on the connection to the manager; i\[char46]e\[char46] \fBstrerror(errno)\fR\[char46] This key will exist only if an error has occurred\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : state\fR: optional string, one of \fBACTIVE\fR, \fBBACKOFF\fR, \fBCONNECTING\fR, \fBIDLE\fR, or \fBVOID\fR"

These values may change in the future\[char46] They are provided only for human consumption\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : sec_since_connect\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
The amount of time since this client last successfully connected to the database (in seconds)\[char46] Value is empty if client has never successfully been connected\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : sec_since_disconnect\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
The amount of time since this client last disconnected from the database (in seconds)\[char46] Value is empty if client has never disconnected\[char46]

Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that the connection has had stolen by another OVSDB client\[char46] Omitted if no locks have been stolen from this connection\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : n_connections\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 2"
When \fBtarget\fR specifies a connection method that listens for inbound connections (e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBptcp:\fR or \fBpssl:\fR) and more than one connection is actually active, the value is the number of active connections\[char46] Otherwise, this key-value pair is omitted\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : bound_port\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
When \fBtarget\fR is \fBptcp:\fR or \fBpssl:\fR, this is the TCP port on which the OVSDB server is listening\[char46] (This is particularly useful when \fBtarget\fR specifies a port of 0, allowing the kernel to choose any available port\[char46])
.ST "Connection Parameters:"
.PP
.IP "\fBother_config : dscp\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified using 6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP header\[char46] DSCP provides a mechanism to classify the network traffic and provide Quality of Service (QoS) on IP networks\[char46] The DSCP value specified here is used when establishing the connection between the manager and the Open vSwitch\[char46] If no value is specified, a default value of 48 is chosen\[char46] Valid DSCP values must be in the range 0 to 63\[char46]
