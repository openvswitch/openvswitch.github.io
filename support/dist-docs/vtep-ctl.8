.SH NAME
vtep\-ctl \- utility for querying and configuring a VTEP database
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand
\fR[\fIargs\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIargs\fR]]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvtep\-ctl\fR program configures a VTEP database.
See \fBvtep\fR(5) for comprehensive documentation of
the database schema.
.PP
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR connects to an \fBovsdb\-server\fR process that
maintains a VTEP configuration database.  Using this connection, it
queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on the
supplied commands.
.PP
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR can perform any number of commands in a single run,
implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.
.PP
The \fBvtep\-ctl\fR command line begins with global options (see
\fBOPTIONS\fR below for details).  The global options are followed by
one or more commands.  Each command should begin with \fB\-\-\fR by
itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the following
commands.  (The \fB\-\-\fR before the first command is optional.)  The
command itself starts with command-specific options, if any, followed by
the command name and any arguments.  See \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for syntax
examples.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
The following options affect the behavior \fBvtep\-ctl\fR as a whole.
Some individual commands also accept their own options, which are
given just before the command name.  If the first command on the
command line has options, then those options must be separated from
the global options by \fB\-\-\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-db=\fIserver\fR"
Sets \fIserver\fR as the database server that \fBvtep\-ctl\fR contacts
to query or modify configuration.  \fIserver\fR may be an OVSDB active
or passive connection method, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).  The
default is \fBunix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-syslog\fR"
By default, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR logs its arguments and the details of any
changes that it makes to the system log.  This option disables this
logging.
.IP
This option is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose=vtep_ctl:syslog:warn\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-oneline\fR"
Modifies the output format so that the output for each command is printed
on a single line.  New-line characters that would otherwise separate
lines are printed as \fB\\n\fR, and any instances of \fB\\\fR that
would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.
Prints a blank line for each command that has no output.
This option does not affect the formatting of output from the
\fBlist\fR or \fBfind\fR commands; see \fBTable Formatting Options\fR
below.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
Prevents \fBvtep\-ctl\fR from actually modifying the database.
.
.IP "\fB\-t \fIsecs\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fR"
By default, or with a \fIsecs\fR of \fB0\fR, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR waits
forever for a response from the database.  This option limits runtime
to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds.  If the timeout expires,
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR signal.  (A timeout
would normally happen only if the database cannot be contacted, or if
the system is overloaded.)
.
.SS "Table Formatting Options"
These options control the format of output from the \fBlist\fR and
\fBfind\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-f \fIformat\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-format=\fIformat\fR"
Sets the type of table formatting.  The following types of
\fIformat\fR are available:
.RS
.ie '\*(PN'ovsdb\-client' .IP "\fBtable\fR (default)"
.el                       .IP "\fBtable\fR"
2-D text tables with aligned columns.
.ie '\*(PN'ovsdb\-client' .IP "\fBlist\fR"
.el                       .IP "\fBlist\fR (default)"
A list with one column per line and rows separated by a blank line.
.IP "\fBhtml\fR"
HTML tables.
.IP "\fBcsv\fR"
Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.
.IP "\fBjson\fR"
JSON format as defined in RFC 4627.  The output is a sequence of JSON
objects, each of which corresponds to one table.  Each JSON object has
the following members with the noted values:
.RS
.IP "\fBcaption\fR"
The table's caption.  This member is omitted if the table has no
caption.
.IP "\fBheadings\fR"
An array with one element per table column.  Each array element is a
string giving the corresponding column's heading.
.IP "\fBdata\fR"
An array with one element per table row.  Each element is also an
array with one element per table column.  The elements of this
second-level array are the cells that constitute the table.  Cells
that represent OVSDB data or data types are expressed in the format
described in the OVSDB specification; other cells are simply expressed
as text strings.
.RE
.RE
.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIformat\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-data=\fIformat\fR"
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless the table
format is set to \fBjson\fR, in which case \fBjson\fR formatting is
always used when formatting cells.  The following types of \fIformat\fR
are available:
.RS
.IP "\fBstring\fR (default)"
The simple format described in the \fBDatabase Values\fR
.ie '\*(PN'ovs\-vsctl' section below.
.el                    section of \fBovs\-vsctl\fR(8).
.IP "\fBbare\fR"
The simple format with punctuation stripped off: \fB[]\fR and \fB{}\fR
are omitted around sets, maps, and empty columns, items within sets
and maps are space-separated, and strings are never quoted.  This
format may be easier for scripts to parse.
.IP "\fBjson\fR"
The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.
.RE
.IP
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-headings\fR"
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears in the
first row of table output.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-pretty\fR"
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as possible.  This
option causes JSON in output to be printed in a more readable
fashion.  Members of objects and elements of arrays are printed one
per line, with indentation.
.IP
This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is always printed
compactly.
.IP "\fB\-\-bare\fR"
Equivalent to \fB\-\-format=list \-\-data=bare \-\-no\-headings\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-column-width=\fIn\fR"
For table output only, limits the width of any column in the output to
\fIn\fR columns.  Longer cell data is truncated to fit, as necessary.
Columns are always wide enough to display the column names, if the
heading row is printed.
.
.SS "Public Key Infrastructure Options"
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIprivkey.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-private\-key=\fIprivkey.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as \fB\*(PN\fR's
identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.
.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIcert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-certificate=\fIcert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
private key specified on \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-private\-key\fR to be
trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the certificate
authority (CA) that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to
verify it.
.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIcacert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that \fB\*(PN\fR
should use to verify certificates presented to it by SSL/TLS peers.
(This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use to verify the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may
be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
.
.IP "\fB\-C none\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=none\fR"
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL/TLS peers.  This
introduces a security risk, because it means that certificates cannot
be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
When \fIcacert.pem\fR exists, this option has the same effect as
\fB\-C\fR or \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.  If it does not exist, then
\fB\*(PN\fR will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the
SSL/TLS peer on its first SSL/TLS connection and save it to the named
PEM file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection
and reconnect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be
authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus
obtained.
.IP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL/TLS connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.IP
This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA certificate
as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS protocols do not
require the server to send the CA certificate.
.IP
This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-C\fR and
\fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-peer\-ca\-cert=\fIpeer-cacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional certificates
to send to SSL/TLS peers.  \fIpeer-cacert.pem\fR should be the CA
certificate used to sign \fB\*(PN\fR's own certificate, that is, the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR.  If
\fB\*(PN\fR's certificate is self-signed, then \fB\-\-certificate\fR
and \fB\-\-peer\-ca\-cert\fR should specify the same file.
.IP
This option is not useful in normal operation, because the SSL/TLS peer
must already have the CA certificate for the peer to have any
confidence in \fB\*(PN\fR's identity.  However, this offers a way for
a new installation to bootstrap the CA certificate on its first SSL/TLS
connection.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.  (If \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR closes
its standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
effect.)
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIdestination\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vFACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=FACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. \fIfacility\fR can be one of
\fBkern\fR, \fBuser\fR, \fBmail\fR, \fBdaemon\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBsyslog\fR,
\fBlpr\fR, \fBnews\fR, \fBuucp\fR, \fBclock\fR, \fBftp\fR, \fBntp\fR,
\fBaudit\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBclock2\fR, \fBlocal0\fR, \fBlocal1\fR,
\fBlocal2\fR, \fBlocal3\fR, \fBlocal4\fR, \fBlocal5\fR, \fBlocal6\fR or
\fBlocal7\fR. If this option is not specified, \fBdaemon\fR is used as
the default for the local system syslog and \fBlocal0\fR is used while sending
a message to the target provided via the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-method=\fImethod\fR"
Specify \fImethod\fR how syslog messages should be sent to syslog daemon.
Following forms are supported:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBlibc\fR, use libc \fBsyslog()\fR function.
Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over \fB/dev/log\fR
UNIX domain socket.
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fR\fR, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possible to
specify arbitrary message format with this option.  However,
\fBrsyslogd 8.9\fR and older versions use hard coded parser function anyway
that limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use arbitrary message
format with older \fBrsyslogd\fR versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
IP address instead.
.IP \(bu
\fBudp:\fIip\fR:\fIport\fR\fR, use UDP socket.  With this method it is
possible to use arbitrary message format also with older \fBrsyslogd\fR.
When sending syslog messages over UDP socket extra precaution needs to
be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be
interfering with local syslog traffic and there are some security
considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain
sockets.
.IP \(bu
\fBnull\fR, discards all messages logged to syslog.
.RE
.IP
The default is taken from the \fBOVS_SYSLOG_METHOD\fR environment
variable; if it is unset, the default is \fBlibc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-help\fR"
Prints a brief help message to the console.
.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-version\fR"
Prints version information to the console.
.
.SH COMMANDS
The commands implemented by \fBvtep\-ctl\fR are described in the
sections below.

.
.SS "Port Commands"
.
These commands examine and manipulate VTEP physical ports.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ports \fIpswitch\fR"
Lists all of the ports within \fIpswitch\fR on standard output, one per
line.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-port \fIpswitch port\fR"
Creates on \fIpswitch\fR a new port named \fIport\fR from the network
device of the same name.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a port that exists

.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-port \fR[\fIpswitch\fR] \fIport\fR"
Deletes \fIport\fR.  If \fIpswitch\fR is omitted, \fIport\fR is removed
from whatever switch contains it; if \fIpswitch\fR is specified, it
must be the switch that contains \fIport\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a port that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a port that does not exist has no effect.

combination on the physical switch \fIpswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBunbind\-ls \fIpswitch port vlan\fR"
Remove the logical switch binding from the \fIport\fR/\fIvlan\fR
combination on the physical switch \fIpswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-bindings \fIpswitch port\fR"
List the logical switch bindings for \fIport\fR on the physical switch
\fIpswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBset\-replication\-mode \fIlswitch replication\-mode\fR"
Set logical switch \fIlswitch\fR replication mode to
\fIreplication\-mode\fR; the only valid values for replication mode
are "service_node" and "source_node".
.
For handling L2 broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic,
packets can be sent to all members of a logical switch referenced by
a physical switch.  There are different modes to replicate the
packets.  The default mode of replication is to send the traffic to
a service node, which can be a hypervisor, server or appliance, and
let the service node handle replication to other transport nodes
(hypervisors or other VTEP physical switches).  This mode is called
service node replication.  An alternate mode of replication, called
source node replication involves the source node sending to all
other transport nodes.  Hypervisors are always responsible for doing
their own replication for locally attached VMs in both modes.
Service node mode is the default, if the replication mode is not
explicitly set.  Service node replication mode is considered a basic
requirement because it only requires sending the packet to a single
transport node.
.
.IP "\fBget\-replication\-mode \fIlswitch\fR"
Get logical switch \fIlswitch\fR replication mode.  The only valid values
for replication mode are "service_node" and "source_node".  An empty reply
for replication mode implies a default of "service_node".
.
.SS "Logical Router Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate logical routers.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-lr \fIlrouter\fR"
Creates a new logical router named \fIlrouter\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a router that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIlrouter\fR already exists.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-lr \fIlrouter\fR"
Deletes \fIlrouter\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a router that does

.SS "Manager Connectivity"
.
These commands manipulate the \fBmanagers\fR column in the \fBGlobal\fR
table and rows in the \fBManagers\fR table.  When \fBovsdb\-server\fR is
configured to use the \fBmanagers\fR column for OVSDB connections (as
described in the startup scripts provided with Open vSwitch), this
allows the administrator to use \fBvtep\-ctl\fR to configure database
connections.

.IP "\fBdel\-manager\fR"
Deletes the configured manager(s).

.IP "\fBset\-manager\fR \fItarget\fR\&..."
Sets the configured manager target or targets.
Each \fItarget\fR may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method,
e.g. \fBpssl:6640\fR, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).
.
.SS "Database Commands"
.
These commands query and modify the contents of \fBovsdb\fR tables.
They are a slight abstraction of the \fBovsdb\fR interface and as such
they operate at a lower level than other \fBvtep\-ctl\fR commands.
.PP
.ST "Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns"
.PP
Each of these commands has a \fItable\fR parameter to identify a table
within the database.  Many of them also take a \fIrecord\fR parameter
that identifies a particular record within a table.  The \fIrecord\fR
parameter may be the UUID for a record, and many tables offer
additional ways to identify records.  Some commands also take
\fIcolumn\fR parameters that identify a particular field within the
records in a table.
.PP
The following tables are currently defined:
.IP "\fBGlobal\fR"
Top-level configuration for a hardware VTEP.  This table contains
exactly one record, identified by specifying \fB.\fR as the record name.
.IP "\fBManager\fR"
Configuration for an OVSDB connection.  Records may be identified
by target (e.g. \fBtcp:1.2.3.4\fR).
.IP "\fBPhysical_Switch\fR"
A physical switch that implements a VTEP.  Records may be identified by
physical switch name.
.IP "\fBPhysical_Port\fR"
A port within a physical switch.
.IP "\fBLogical_Binding_Stats\fR"
Reports statistics for the logical switch with which a VLAN on a
physical port is associated.
.IP "\fBLogical_Switch\fR"
A logical Ethernet switch.  Records may be identified by logical switch
name.
.IP "\fBUcast_Macs_Local\fR"
Mapping of locally discovered unicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBUcast_Macs_Remote\fR"
Mapping of remotely programmed unicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBMcast_Macs_Local\fR"
Mapping of locally discovered multicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBMcast_Macs_Remote\fR"
Mapping of remotely programmed multicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBPhysical_Locator_Set\fR"
A set of one or more physical locators.
.IP "\fBPhysical_Locator\fR"
Identifies an endpoint to which logical switch traffic may be
encapsulated and forwarded.  Records may be identified by physical
locator name.
.PP
Record names must be specified in full and with correct
capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first 4
(or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table.
Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and \fB\-\fR and
\fB_\fR are treated interchangeably.  Unique abbreviations of table
and column names are acceptable, e.g. \fBman\fR or \fBm\fR is
sufficient to identify the \fBManager\fR table.
.
.ST "Database Values"
.PP
Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data.  The
currently defined basic types, and their representations, are:
.IP "integer"
A decimal integer in the range \-2**63 to 2**63\-1, inclusive.
.IP "real"
A floating-point number.
.IP "Boolean"
True or false, written \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR, respectively.
.IP "string"
An arbitrary Unicode string, except that null bytes are not allowed.
Quotes are optional for most strings that begin with an English letter
or underscore and consist only of letters, underscores, hyphens, and
periods.  However, \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR and strings that match
the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes to
distinguish them from other basic types.  When double quotes are used,
the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e.g. backslashes may be used to
escape special characters.  The empty string must be represented as a
pair of double quotes (\fB""\fR).
.IP "UUID"
Either a universally unique identifier in the style of RFC 4122,
e.g. \fBf81d4fae\-7dec\-11d0\-a765\-00a0c91e6bf6\fR, or an \fB@\fIname\fR
defined by a \fBget\fR or \fBcreate\fR command within the same \fB\*(PN\fR
invocation.
.PP
Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a
single comma.  When multiple values are present, duplicates are not
allowed, and order is not important.  Conversely, some database
columns can have an empty set of values, represented as \fB[]\fR, and
square brackets may optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single
values as well. For a column accepting a set of integers, database commands
accept a range. A range is represented by two integers separated by
\fB-\fR. A range is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of 4096
elements. If more elements are needed, they can be specified in separate
ranges.
.PP
A few database columns are ``maps'' of key-value pairs, where the key
and the value are each some fixed database type.  These are specified
in the form \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR, where \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR
follow the syntax for the column's key type and value type,
respectively.  When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or
a comma), duplicate keys are not allowed, and again the order is not
important.  Duplicate values are allowed.  An empty map is represented
as \fB{}\fR.  Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty maps as
well (but use quotes to prevent the shell from expanding
\fBother-config={0=x,1=y}\fR into \fBother-config=0=x
other-config=1=y\fR, which may not have the desired effect).

.IP "[\fB\-\-columns=\fIcolumn\fR[\fB,\fIcolumn\fR]...] \fBfind \fItable \fR[\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]\fB=\fIvalue\fR]..."
Lists the data in each record in \fItable\fR whose \fIcolumn\fR equals
\fIvalue\fR or, if \fIkey\fR is specified, whose \fIcolumn\fR contains
a \fIkey\fR with the specified \fIvalue\fR.  The following operators
may be used where \fB=\fR is written in the syntax summary:
.RS
.IP "\fB= != < > <= >=\fR"
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] equals, does not
equal, is less than, is greater than, is less than or equal to, or is
greater than or equal to \fIvalue\fR, respectively.
.IP
Consider \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] and \fIvalue\fR as sets of
elements.  Identical sets are considered equal.  Otherwise, if the
sets have different numbers of elements, then the set with more
elements is considered to be larger.  Otherwise, consider a element
from each set pairwise, in increasing order within each set.  The
first pair that differs determines the result.  (For a column that
contains key-value pairs, first all the keys are compared, and values
are considered only if the two sets contain identical keys.)
.IP "\fB{=} {!=}\fR"
Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.
.IP "\fB{<=}\fR"
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] is a subset of
\fIvalue\fR.  For example, \fBflood-vlans{<=}1,2\fR selects records in
which the \fBflood-vlans\fR column is the empty set or contains 1 or 2
or both.
.IP "\fB{<}\fR"
Selects records in which \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR] is a proper
subset of \fIvalue\fR.  For example, \fBflood-vlans{<}1,2\fR selects
records in which the \fBflood-vlans\fR column is the empty set or
contains 1 or 2 but not both.
.IP "\fB{>=} {>}\fR"
Same as \fB{<=}\fR and \fB{<}\fR, respectively, except that the
relationship is reversed.  For example, \fBflood-vlans{>=}1,2\fR
selects records in which the \fBflood-vlans\fR column contains both 1
and 2.
.PP
The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch 2.16 and
later:
.IP "\fB{in}\fR"
Selects records in which every element in \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]
is also in \fIvalue\fR.  (This is the same as \fB{<=}\fR.)
.IP "\fB{not-in}\fR"
Selects records in which every element in \fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]
is not in \fIvalue\fR.
.RE
.IP
For arithmetic operators (\fB= != < > <= >=\fR), when \fIkey\fR is
specified but a particular record's \fIcolumn\fR does not contain
\fIkey\fR, the record is always omitted from the results.  Thus, the
condition \fBother-config:mtu!=1500\fR matches records that have a
\fBmtu\fR key whose value is not 1500, but not those that lack an
\fBmtu\fR key.
.IP
For the set operators, when \fIkey\fR is specified but a particular
record's \fIcolumn\fR does not contain \fIkey\fR, the comparison is
done against an empty set.  Thus, the condition
\fBother-config:mtu{!=}1500\fR matches records that have a \fBmtu\fR
key whose value is not 1500 and those that lack an \fBmtu\fR key.

Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only when they

records that are not reachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are
automatically deleted from the database.  This deletion happens
immediately, without waiting for additional \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands
