<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-vswitchd.conf.db - Open_vSwitch database schema

       A  database  with  this  schema  holds  the  configuration for one Open
       vSwitch daemon. The top-level  configuration  for  the  daemon  is  the
       <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table,  which  must  have  exactly one record. Records in
       other tables are significant only when they can be reached directly  or
       indirectly  from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. Records that are not reachable
       from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table are automatically deleted  from  the  data‐
       base, except for records in a few distinguished ``root set’’ tables.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Columns</b>
       Most  tables contain two special columns, named <b>other_config</b> and <b>exter‐</b>
       <b>nal_ids</b>. These columns have the same form and purpose each  place  that
       they appear, so we describe them here to save space later.

              <b>other_config</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value  pairs  for  configuring  rarely used features.
                     Supported keys, along with the forms taken by their  val‐
                     ues, are documented individually for each table.

                     A  few tables do not have <b>other_config</b> columns because no
                     key-value pairs have yet been defined for them.

              <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that inte‐
                     grate with Open vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch  it‐
                     self.  System  integrators  should  either  use  the Open
                     vSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on  common
                     key-value  definitions,  or  choose  key  names  that are
                     likely to be unique. In some cases, where key-value pairs
                     have been defined that are likely to  be  widely  useful,
                     they are documented individually for each table.

     <u>Configuration:</u>

       <b>datapaths</b>: map of string-<b>Datapath</b> pairs
              Map of datapath types to datapaths. The <b>datapath_type</b> column  of
              the <b>Bridge</b> table is used as a key for this map. The value points
              to a row in the <b>Datapath</b> table.

       <b>bridges</b>: set of <b>Bridge</b>s
              Set of bridges managed by the daemon.

       <b>ssl</b>: optional <b>SSL</b>
              SSL/TLS used globally by the daemon.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>system-id</b>: optional string
              A  unique  identifier  for the Open vSwitch’s physical host. The
              form of the identifier depends on the type of the host.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>hostname</b>: optional string
              The hostname for the host running Open vSwitch. This is a  fully
              qualified domain name since version 2.6.2.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>rundir</b>: optional string
              In  Open vSwitch 2.8 and later, the run directory of the running
              Open vSwitch daemon. This directory is used  for  runtime  state
              such  as control and management sockets. The value of <b>other_con‐</b>
              <b>fig:vhost-sock-dir</b> is relative to this directory.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stats-update-interval</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 5,000
              Interval for updating statistics to the database,  in  millisec‐
              onds.  This option will affect the update of the <b>statistics</b> col‐
              umn in the following tables: <b>Port</b>, <b>Interface</b> , <b>Mirror</b>.

              Default value is 5000 ms.

              Getting statistics more frequently can be achieved via OpenFlow.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>flow-restore-wait</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              When <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> starts up, it has  an  empty  flow  table  and
              therefore it handles all arriving packets in its default fashion
              according to its configuration, by dropping them or sending them
              to  an  OpenFlow  controller  or  switching them as a standalone
              switch. This  behavior  is  ordinarily  desirable.  However,  if
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  is  restarting  as part of a ``hot-upgrade,’’ then
              this leads to a relatively long period during which packets  are
              mishandled.

              This  option  allows  for  improvement. When <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> starts
              with this value set as <b>true</b>, it will  neither  flush  or  expire
              previously  set  datapath flows nor will it send and receive any
              packets to or from the datapath. When this value is later set to
              <b>false</b>, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will start receiving packets from the  data‐
              path and re-setup the flows.

              Additionally,  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is prevented from connecting to con‐
              trollers when this value is set  to  <b>true</b>.  This  prevents  con‐
              trollers  from making changes to the flow table in the middle of
              flow restoration, which could result in undesirable intermediate
              states. Once this value has been set to <b>false</b>  and  the  desired
              flow  state  has been restored, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will be able to re‐
              connect to controllers and process any new flow table  modifica‐
              tions.

              Thus,  with  this  option,  the  procedure  for a hot-upgrade of
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> becomes roughly the following:

              1.  Stop <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

              2.  Set <b>other_config:flow-restore-wait</b> to <b>true</b>.

              3.  Start <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

              4.  Use <b>ovs-ofctl</b> (or some other program, such  as  an  OpenFlow
                  controller)  to  restore  the OpenFlow flow table to the de‐
                  sired state.

              5.  Set <b>other_config:flow-restore-wait</b> to <b>false</b>  (or  remove  it
                  entirely from the database).

              The  <b>ovs-ctl</b>’s  ``restart’’  and ``force-reload-kmod’’ functions
              use the above config option during hot upgrades.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>flow-limit</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              The maximum number of flows allowed in the datapath flow  table.
              Internally  OVS  will  choose  a flow limit which will likely be
              lower than this number, based on real time  network  conditions.
              Tweaking  this value is discouraged unless you know exactly what
              you’re doing.

              The default is 200000.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>max-idle</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 500
              The maximum time (in ms) that idle flows will remain  cached  in
              the  datapath. Internally OVS will check the validity and activ‐
              ity for datapath flows regularly and may  expire  flows  quicker
              than  this number, based on real time network conditions. Tweak‐
              ing this value is  discouraged  unless  you  know  exactly  what
              you’re doing.

              The default is 10000.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>max-revalidator</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 100
              The  maximum time (in ms) that revalidator threads will wait be‐
              fore executing flow revalidation. Note that this is maximum  al‐
              lowed  value.  Actual timeout used by OVS is minimum of max-idle
              and max-revalidator values. Tweaking this value  is  discouraged
              unless you know exactly what you’re doing.

              The default is 500.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>min-revalidate-pps</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Set  minimum  pps that flow must have in order to be revalidated
              when revalidation duration exceeds half of max-revalidator  con‐
              fig variable. Setting to 0 means always revalidate flows regard‐
              less of pps.

              The default is 5.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>offloaded-stats-delay</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, at least 0
              Set  worst case delay (in ms) it might take before statistics of
              offloaded flows are updated. Offloaded flows younger  than  this
              delay will always be revalidated regardless of <b>other_config:min-</b>
              <b>revalidate-pps</b>.

              The default is 2000.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>hw-offload</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Set this value to <b>true</b> to enable netdev flow offload.

              The  default  value  is  <b>false</b>.  Changing  this  value  requires
              restarting the daemon

              Currently Open vSwitch supports  hardware  offloading  on  Linux
              systems. On other systems, this value is ignored. This function‐
              ality  is considered ’experimental’. Depending on which OpenFlow
              matches and actions are  configured,  which  kernel  version  is
              used,  and  what  hardware is available, Open vSwitch may not be
              able to offload functionality to hardware.

              In  order  to   dump   HW   offloaded   flows   use   <b>ovs-appctl</b>
              <b>dpctl/dump-flows</b>,  <b>ovs-dpctl</b> doesn’t support this functionality.
              See ovs-vswitchd(8) for details.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>n-offload-threads</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 1 to 10
              Set this value to the number of threads created to manage  hard‐
              ware offloads.

              The  default value is <b>1</b>. Changing this value requires restarting
              the daemon.

              This is  only  relevant  for  userspace  datapath  and  only  if
              <b>other_config:hw-offload</b> is enabled.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>tc-policy</b>: optional string, one of <b>none</b>, <b>skip_hw</b>, or
       <b>skip_sw</b>
              Specified the policy used with HW offloading. Options:

              <b>none</b>   Add software rule and offload rule to HW.

              <b>skip_sw</b>
                     Offload rule to HW only.

              <b>skip_hw</b>
                     Add software rule without offloading rule to HW.

              This is only relevant if <b>other_config:hw-offload</b> is enabled.

              The default value is <b>none</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-init</b>: optional string, one of <b>false</b>, <b>true</b>, or <b>try</b>
              Set this value to <b>true</b> or <b>try</b> to enable runtime support for DPDK
              ports.  The  vswitch  must have compile-time support for DPDK as
              well.

              A value of <b>true</b> will cause the ovs-vswitchd process to abort  if
              DPDK  cannot  be initialized. A value of <b>try</b> will allow the ovs-
              vswitchd process to continue running even if DPDK cannot be ini‐
              tialized.

              The  default  value  is  <b>false</b>.  Changing  this  value  requires
              restarting the daemon

              If this value is <b>false</b> at startup, any dpdk ports which are con‐
              figured in the bridge will fail due to memory errors.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-lcore-mask</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 1
              Specifies  the  CPU  cores  where  dpdk  lcore threads should be
              spawned. The DPDK lcore threads are used for DPDK library tasks,
              such as library internal message processing, logging, etc. Value
              should be in the form of a hex string (so  ’0x123’)  similar  to
              the ’taskset’ mask input.

              The  lowest  order  bit corresponds to the first CPU core. A set
              bit means the corresponding  core  is  available  and  an  lcore
              thread  will  be created and pinned to it. If the input does not
              cover all cores, those uncovered cores are considered not set.

              For performance reasons, it is best to set this to a single core
              on the system, rather than allow lcore threads to float.

              If not specified, the value will be determined by  choosing  the
              lowest  CPU  core from initial cpu affinity list. Otherwise, the
              value will be passed directly to the DPDK library.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-cpu-mask</b>: optional string
              Specifies CPU mask for setting the cpu  affinity  of  PMD  (Poll
              Mode Driver) threads. Value should be in the form of hex string,
              similar  to  the  dpdk  EAL  ’-c  COREMASK’  option input or the
              ’taskset’ mask input.

              The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU  core.  A  set
              bit  means  the corresponding core is available and a pmd thread
              will be created and pinned to it. If the input  does  not  cover
              all cores, those uncovered cores are considered not set.

              If  not  specified, one pmd thread will be created for each numa
              node and pinned to any available core on the numa  node  by  de‐
              fault.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-alloc-mem</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              Specifies  the amount of memory to preallocate from the hugepage
              pool, regardless of socket. It is recommended that  dpdk-socket-
              mem is used instead.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-socket-mem</b>: optional string
              Specifies  the amount of memory to preallocate from the hugepage
              pool, on a per-socket basis.

              The specifier is a comma-separated string, in ascending order of
              CPU socket. E.g. On a four socket system 1024,0,2048  would  set
              socket  0  to  preallocate  1024MB, socket 1 to preallocate 0MB,
              socket 2 to preallocate 2048MB and socket 3 (no value given)  to
              preallocate 0MB.

              If  <b>other_config:dpdk-socket-mem</b> and <b>other_config:dpdk-alloc-mem</b>
              are not specified, neither will be used and there will be no de‐
              fault value for each numa node. DPDK defaults will be  used  in‐
              stead. If <b>other_config:dpdk-socket-mem</b> and <b>other_config:dpdk-al‐</b>
              <b>loc-mem</b>  are  specified  at  the  same  time, <b>other_config:dpdk-</b>
              <b>socket-mem</b> will be used as default. Changing this value requires
              restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-socket-limit</b>: optional string
              Limits the maximum amount of memory that can be  used  from  the
              hugepage pool, on a per-socket basis.

              The  specifier  is  a  comma-separated list of memory limits per
              socket. <b>0</b> will disable the limit for a particular socket.

              If not specified, OVS will  not  configure  limits  by  default.
              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-hugepage-dir</b>: optional string
              Specifies the path to the hugetlbfs mount point.

              If  not specified, this will be guessed by the DPDK library (de‐
              fault is /dev/hugepages). Changing this value requires  restart‐
              ing the daemon.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-extra</b>: optional string
              Specifies additional eal command line arguments for DPDK.

              The  default  is  empty. Changing this value requires restarting
              the daemon

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>vhost-sock-dir</b>: optional string
              Specifies a relative path from <b>external_ids:rundir</b> to the vhost-
              user unix domain socket files. If this value is unset, the sock‐
              ets are put directly in <b>external_ids:rundir</b>.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>vhost-iommu-support</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              vHost IOMMU is a security feature,  which  restricts  the  vhost
              memory  that  a virtio device may access. vHost IOMMU support is
              disabled by default, due to a bug in QEMU implementations of the
              vhost REPLY_ACK protocol, (on which vHost IOMMU relies) prior to
              v2.9.1. Setting this value to <b>true</b> enables vHost  IOMMU  support
              for  vHost  User  Client  ports  in OvS-DPDK, starting from DPDK
              v17.11.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>vhost-postcopy-support</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              vHost post-copy is a feature which allows switching live  migra‐
              tion  of  VM  attached  to dpdkvhostuserclient port to post-copy
              mode if default pre-copy migration can not be converged or takes
              too long to converge. Setting this value to <b>true</b>  enables  vHost
              post-copy  support  for all dpdkvhostuserclient ports. Available
              starting from DPDK v18.11 and QEMU 2.12.

              Changing this value requires restarting the daemon.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>per-port-memory</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              By default OVS DPDK uses a shared memory model  wherein  devices
              that have the same MTU and socket values can share the same mem‐
              pool.  Setting  this  value  to <b>true</b> changes this behaviour. Per
              port memory allow DPDK devices to use private memory per device.
              This can provide greater transparency as  regards  memory  usage
              but potentially at the cost of greater memory requirements.

              Changing  this value requires restarting the daemon if dpdk-init
              has already been set to true.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>shared-mempool-config</b>: optional string
              Specifies dpdk shared mempool config.

              Value should be set in the following form:

              <b>pool-mtu-list&gt;</b>

              where

              •      &lt;user-shared-mempool-mtu-list&gt;  ::=  NULL  |  &lt;non-empty-
                     list&gt;

              •      &lt;non-empty-list&gt; ::= &lt;user-mtus&gt; |  &lt;user-mtus&gt;  ,  &lt;non-
                     empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;user-mtus&gt; ::= &lt;mtu-all-socket&gt; | &lt;mtu-socket-pair&gt;

              •      &lt;mtu-all-socket&gt; ::= &lt;mtu&gt;

              •      &lt;mtu-socket-pair&gt; ::= &lt;mtu&gt; : &lt;socket-id&gt;

              Changing  this value requires restarting the daemon if dpdk-init
              has already been set to true.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>tx-flush-interval</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 0 to 1,000,000
              Specifies the time in microseconds that a  packet  can  wait  in
              output  batch  for  sending  i.e. amount of time that packet can
              spend in an intermediate output queue before sending to  netdev.
              This  option can be used to configure balance between throughput
              and latency. Lower values decreases latency while higher  values
              may be useful to achieve higher performance.

              Defaults to 0 i.e. instant packet sending (latency optimized).

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-perf-metrics</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Enables recording of detailed PMD performance metrics for analy‐
              sis  and trouble-shooting. This can have a performance impact in
              the order of 1%.

              Defaults to false but can be changed at any time.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>smc-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Signature match cache or SMC is a cache between EMC and megaflow
              cache. It does not store the full key of the flow, so it is more
              memory efficient comparing to EMC cache. SMC is especially  use‐
              ful when flow count is larger than EMC capacity.

              Defaults to false but can be changed at any time.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-rxq-assign</b>: optional string, one of <b>cycles</b>, <b>group</b>,
       or <b>roundrobin</b>
              Specifies  how  RX  queues will be automatically assigned to CPU
              cores. Options:

              <b>cycles</b> Rxqs will be sorted by order of measured  processing  cy‐
                     cles before being assigned to CPU cores.

              <b>roundrobin</b>
                     Rxqs will be round-robined across CPU cores.

              <b>group</b>  Rxqs  will  be sorted by order of measured processing cy‐
                     cles before being assigned to CPU cores with lowest esti‐
                     mated load.

              The default value is <b>cycles</b>.

              Changing this value will affect an  automatic  re-assignment  of
              Rxqs to CPUs. Note: Rxqs mapped to CPU cores with <b>pmd-rxq-affin‐</b>
              <b>ity</b> are unaffected.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-rxq-isolate</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Specifies if a CPU core will be isolated after being pinned with
              an Rx queue.

              Set  this  value  to <b>false</b> to non-isolate a CPU core after it is
              pinned with an Rxq using <b>pmd-rxq-affinity</b>. This will  allow  OVS
              to assign other Rxqs to that CPU core.

              The default value is <b>true</b>.

              This can only be <b>false</b> when <b>pmd-rxq-assign</b> is set to <b>group</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>n-handler-threads</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 1
              Attempts to specify the number of threads for software datapaths
              to  use for handling new flows. Some datapaths may choose to ig‐
              nore this and it will be set to a sensible option for the  data‐
              path type.

              This  configuration  is  per datapath. If you have more than one
              software datapath (e.g. some  <b>system</b>  bridges  and  some  <b>netdev</b>
              bridges),  then the total number of threads is <b>n-handler-threads</b>
              times the number of software datapaths.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>n-revalidator-threads</b>: optional string, containing an

              Attempts to specify the number of threads for software datapaths
              to use for revalidating flows in the  datapath.  Some  datapaths
              may  choose to ignore this and will set to a sensible option for
              the datapath type.

              Typically, there is a direct correlation between the  number  of
              revalidator  threads,  and  the  number  of flows allowed in the
              datapath. The default is the number of cpu cores divided by four
              plus one. If <b>n-handler-threads</b> is set, the  default  changes  to
              the number of cpu cores minus the number of handler threads.

              This  configuration  is  per datapath. If you have more than one
              software datapath (e.g. some  <b>system</b>  bridges  and  some  <b>netdev</b>
              bridges),  then the total number of threads is <b>n-handler-threads</b>

              flow being inserted into the Exact Match Cache (EMC). On average
              one  in every <b>emc-insert-inv-prob</b> packets that generate a unique
              flow will cause an insertion into the EMC. A value of 1 will re‐
              sult in an insertion for every flow (1/1 = 100%) whereas a value
              of zero will result in no insertions and essentially disable the
              EMC.

              Defaults to 100 ie. there is (1/100 =) 1% chance of  EMC  inser‐
              tion.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>vlan-limit</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              Limits  the  number  of  VLAN headers that can be matched to the
              specified number. Further VLAN headers will be treated  as  pay‐
              load, e.g. a packet with more 802.1q headers will match Ethernet
              type 0x8100.

              Open  vSwitch  userspace currently supports at most 2 VLANs, and
              each datapath has its own limit. If <b>vlan-limit</b>  is  nonzero,  it
              acts as a further limit.

              If  this value is absent, the default is currently 1. This main‐
              tains backward compatibility with controllers that were designed
              for use with Open vSwitch versions earlier than 2.8, which  only
              supported one VLAN.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>bundle-idle-timeout</b>: optional string, containing an in‐
       teger, at least 1
              The  maximum time (in seconds) that idle bundles will wait to be
              expired since it was either opened, modified or closed.

              OpenFlow specification mandates the timeout to be at  least  one
              second. The default is 10 seconds.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>offload-rebalance</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Configures  HW  offload  rebalancing, that allows to dynamically
              offload and un-offload flows while an offload-device is  out  of
              resources (OOR). This policy allows flows to be selected for of‐
              floading based on the packets-per-second (pps) rate of flows.

              Set this value to <b>true</b> to enable this option.

              The  default  value  is  <b>false</b>.  Changing  this  value  requires
              restarting the daemon.

              This is only relevant if HW offloading is enabled  (hw-offload).
              When  this policy is enabled, it also requires ’tc-policy’ to be
              set to ’skip_sw’.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-auto-lb</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Configures PMD Auto Load Balancing that allows automatic assign‐
              ment of RX queues to PMDs if any of PMDs is overloaded  (i.e.  a
              processing cycles &gt; <b>other_config:pmd-auto-lb-load-threshold</b>).

              It  uses  current  scheme of cycle based assignment of RX queues
              that are not statically pinned to PMDs.

              The default value is <b>false</b>.

              Set this value to <b>true</b> to enable this option.  It  is  currently
              disabled by default and an experimental feature.

              This  only  comes in effect if cycle based assignment is enabled
              and there are more than one non-isolated  PMDs  present  and  at
              least one of it polls more than one queue.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-auto-lb-rebal-interval</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 0 to 20,000
              The  minimum  time (in minutes) 2 consecutive PMD Auto Load Bal‐
              ancing iterations.

              The default value is 1 min. If configured to 0 then it would  be
              converted to default value i.e. 1 min

              This  option can be configured to avoid frequent trigger of auto
              load balancing of PMDs. For e.g. set the  value  (in  min)  such
              that it occurs once in few hours or a day or a week.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-auto-lb-load-threshold</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, in range 0 to 100
              Specifies  the  minimum PMD thread load threshold (% of used cy‐
              cles) of any non-isolated PMD threads when a PMD Auto Load  Bal‐
              ance may be triggered.

              The default value is <b>95%</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-auto-lb-improvement-threshold</b>: optional string, con‐
       taining an integer, in range 0 to 100
              Specifies  the minimum evaluated % improvement in load distribu‐
              tion across the non-isolated PMD threads that will allow  a  PMD
              Auto Load Balance to occur.

              Note, setting this parameter to 0 will always allow an auto load
              balance to occur regardless of estimated improvement or not.

              The default value is <b>25%</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-sleep-max</b>: optional string
              Specifies  the  maximum sleep time that will be requested in mi‐
              croseconds per iteration for a PMD  thread  which  has  received
              zero  or  a  small  amount  of  packets from the Rx queues it is
              polling.

              The actual sleep time requested is based on the load of  the  Rx
              queues  that  the  PMD  polls  and  may be less than the maximum
              value.

              The default value is <b>0</b> <b>microseconds</b>, which means  that  the  PMD
              will not sleep regardless of the load from the Rx queues that it
              polls.

              The maximum value is <b>10000</b> <b>microseconds</b>.

              <b>other_config:pmd-sleep-max=&lt;pmd-sleep-list&gt;</b>

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>userspace-tso-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              Set  this value to <b>true</b> to enable userspace support for TCP Seg‐
              mentation Offloading (TSO). When it is enabled,  the  interfaces
              can  provide  an  oversized  TCP segment to the datapath and the
              datapath will offload the TCP segmentation and checksum calcula‐
              tion to the interfaces when necessary.

              The  default  value  is  <b>false</b>.  Changing  this  value  requires
              restarting the daemon.

              The  feature  only works if Open vSwitch is built with DPDK sup‐
              port.

              The feature is considered experimental.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>explicit-sampled-drops</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              When a flow is installed in the datapath with  an  empty  action
              list, it indicates an implicit "drop" action. Most datapaths re‐
              port  this for event for statistics and monitoring (in datapath-
              specific ways).

              However, if any of the per-bridge or per-flow sampling function‐
              alities are enabled (e.g: sFlow, IPFIX, local sampling), the ac‐
              tion list might not be empty, but contain an action to implement
              such functionality. This makes  the  datapaths  not  report  the
              packet drop.

              This  knob  makes Open vSwitch detect when the last datapath ac‐
              tion comes from these sampling features and add an explicit drop
              action at the end to keep drop statistics accurate.

              The default value is <b>false</b>.

     <u>Status:</u>

       <b>next_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence number for client to increment. When a client  modifies
              any  part  of  the database configuration and wishes to wait for
              Open vSwitch to finish applying the changes,  it  may  increment
              this sequence number.

       <b>cur_cfg</b>: integer
              Sequence  number  that Open vSwitch sets to the current value of
              <b>next_cfg</b> after it  finishes  applying  a  set  of  configuration
              changes.

       <b>dpdk_initialized</b>: boolean
              True  if  <b>other_config:dpdk-init</b> is set to true and the DPDK li‐
              brary is successfully initialized.

     <u>Statistics:</u>

       The <b>statistics</b> column contains key-value pairs that  report  statistics
       about  a system running an Open vSwitch. These are updated periodically
       (currently, every 5 seconds). Key-value pairs that cannot be determined
       or that do not apply to a platform are omitted.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>enable-statistics</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Statistics are disabled by default to avoid overhead in the com‐
              mon case when statistics gathering is not useful. Set this value
              to <b>true</b> to enable populating the <b>statistics</b> column or  to  <b>false</b>
              to explicitly disable it.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>cpu</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              Number of CPU processors, threads, or cores currently online and
              available  to the operating system on which Open vSwitch is run‐
              ning, as an integer. This may be less than the number installed,
              if some are not online or if they are not available to the oper‐
              ating system.

              Open vSwitch userspace processes are not multithreaded, but  the
              Linux kernel-based datapath is.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>load_average</b>: optional string
              A  comma-separated  list of three floating-point numbers, repre‐
              senting the system load average over the last 1, 5, and 15  min‐
              utes, respectively.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>memory</b>: optional string
              A  comma-separated  list of integers, each of which represents a
              quantity of memory in kilobytes  that  describes  the  operating
              system  on  which  Open vSwitch is running. In respective order,
              these values are:

              1.  Total amount of RAM allocated to the OS.

              2.  RAM allocated to the OS that is in use.

              3.  RAM that can be flushed out to disk or  otherwise  discarded
                  if  that space is needed for another purpose. This number is
                  necessarily less than or equal to the previous value.

              4.  Total disk space allocated for swap.

              5.  Swap space currently in use.

              On Linux, all five values can be determined and are included. On
              other operating systems, only the first two values can be deter‐
              mined, so the list will only have two values.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>process_NAME</b>: optional string
              One such key-value pair, with <b>NAME</b> replaced by a  process  name,
              will  exist  for  each running Open vSwitch daemon process, with
              <u>name</u> replaced by the daemon’s name (e.g.  <b>process_ovs-vswitchd</b>).
              The  value  is  a comma-separated list of integers. The integers
              represent the following, with memory measured in  kilobytes  and
              durations in milliseconds:

              1.  The process’s virtual memory size.

              2.  The process’s resident set size.

              3.  The  amount  of  user  and  system  CPU time consumed by the
                  process.

              4.  The number of times that the process has  crashed  and  been
                  automatically restarted by the monitor.

              5.  The duration since the process was started.

              6.  The duration for which the process has been running.

              The  interpretation  of  some of these values depends on whether
              the process was started with the <b>--monitor</b>. If it was not,  then
              the  crash count will always be 0 and the two durations will al‐
              ways be the same. If <b>--monitor</b> was given, then the  crash  count
              may  be positive; if it is, the latter duration is the amount of
              time since the most recent crash and restart.

              There will be one key-value pair for each file in Open vSwitch’s
              ``run directory’’ (usually <b>/var/run/openvswitch</b>) whose name ends
              in <b>.pid</b>, whose contents are a process ID, and which is locked by
              a running process. The <u>name</u> is taken from the pidfile’s name.

              Currently Open vSwitch is only able to obtain all of  the  above
              detail  on  Linux  systems. On other systems, the same key-value
              pairs will be present but the values will always  be  the  empty
              string.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>file_systems</b>: optional string
              A  space-separated  list  of information on local, writable file
              systems. Each item in the list describes  one  file  system  and
              consists in turn of a comma-separated list of the following:

              1.  Mount point, e.g. <b>/</b> or <b>/var/log</b>. Any spaces or commas in the
                  mount point are replaced by underscores.

              2.  Total size, in kilobytes, as an integer.

              3.  Amount of storage in use, in kilobytes, as an integer.

              This  key-value  pair is omitted if there are no local, writable
              file systems or if Open vSwitch cannot obtain the needed  infor‐
              mation.

     <u>Version</u> <u>Reporting:</u>

       These  columns  report the types and versions of the hardware and soft‐
       ware running Open vSwitch. We recommend in general that software should
       test whether specific features are supported instead of relying on ver‐
       sion number checks. These values are primarily intended  for  reporting
       to human administrators.

       <b>ovs_version</b>: optional string
              The Open vSwitch version number, e.g. <b>1.1.0</b>.

       <b>db_version</b>: optional string
              The  database  schema  version  number,  e.g.  <b>1.2.3</b>. See ovsdb-
              tool(1) for an explanation of the numbering scheme.

              The schema version is part of the database  schema,  so  it  can
              also  be retrieved by fetching the schema using the Open vSwitch
              database protocol.

       <b>system_type</b>: optional string
              An identifier for the type  of  system  on  top  of  which  Open
              vSwitch runs, e.g. <b>KVM</b>.

              System  integrators  are responsible for choosing and setting an
              appropriate value for this column.

       <b>system_version</b>: optional string
              The version  of  the  system  identified  by  <b>system_type</b>,  e.g.
              <b>4.18.0-372.19.1.el8_6</b> on RHEL 8.6 with kernel 4.18.0-372.19.1.

              System  integrators  are responsible for choosing and setting an
              appropriate value for this column.

       <b>dpdk_version</b>: optional string
              The version of the linked DPDK library.

     <u>Capabilities:</u>

       These columns report capabilities of the Open vSwitch instance.

       <b>datapath_types</b>: set of strings
              This column reports the different dpifs registered with the sys‐
              tem. These are the values that this  instance  supports  in  the
              <b>datapath_type</b> column of the <b>Bridge</b> table.

       <b>iface_types</b>: set of strings
              This  column  reports  the different netdevs registered with the
              system. These are the values that this instance supports in  the
              <b>type</b> column of the <b>Interface</b> table.

     <u>Database</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       These   columns   primarily   configure   the   Open  vSwitch  database
       (<b>ovsdb-server</b>), not the Open vSwitch switch (<b>ovs-vswitchd</b>).  The  OVSDB
       database also uses the <b>ssl</b> settings.

       The  Open vSwitch switch does read the database configuration to deter‐
       mine remote IP addresses to which in-band control should apply.

       <b>manager_options</b>: set of <b>Manager</b>s
              Database clients to  which  the  Open  vSwitch  database  server
              should  connect or to which it should listen, along with options
              for how these connections should be configured. See the  <b>Manager</b>
              table for more information.

              For  this column to serve its purpose, <b>ovsdb-server</b> must be con‐
              figured to honor it. The easiest way to do  this  is  to  invoke
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>         with         the        option        <b>--re‐</b>
              <b>mote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options</b>  The   startup
              scripts that accompany Open vSwitch do this by default.

     <u>IPsec:</u>

       These  settings  control the global configuration of IPsec tunnels. The
       <b>options</b> column of the <b>Interface</b> table configures IPsec  for  individual
       tunnels.  The  <b>options</b>  column  also allows for custom options prefixed
       with <b>ipsec_</b> to be passed to the individual connections.

       OVS IPsec supports the following three forms  of  authentication.  Cur‐
       rently, all IPsec tunnels must use the same form:

              1.  Pre-shared  keys:  Omit the global settings. On each tunnel,
                  set <b>options:psk</b>.

              2.  Self-signed certificates: Set the <b>private_key</b>  and  <b>certifi‐</b>
                  <b>cate</b>  global  settings.  On  each  tunnel,  set  <b>options:re‐</b>
                  <b>mote_cert</b>. The remote certificate can be self-signed.

              3.  CA-signed certificates: Set all of the global  settings.  On
                  each tunnel, set <b>options:remote_name</b> to the common name (CN)
                  of  the  remote  certificate. The remote certificate must be
                  signed by the CA.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>private_key</b>: optional string
              Name of a PEM file  containing  the  private  key  used  as  the
              switch’s identity for IPsec tunnels.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>certificate</b>: optional string
              Name  of  a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              switch’s private key, and identifies a  trustworthy  switch  for
              IPsec  tunnels. The certificate must be x.509 version 3 and with
              the string in common name (CN) also set in the subject  alterna‐
              tive name (SAN).

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>ca_cert</b>: optional string
              Name  of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify
              that a remote switch of the IPsec tunnel is trustworthy.

     <u>Plaintext</u> <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Policy:</u>

       When an IPsec tunnel is configured in this database, multiple  indepen‐
       dent  components  take responsibility for implementing it. <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       and its datapath handle packet forwarding to the tunnel and a  separate
       daemon  pushes the tunnel’s IPsec policy configuration to the kernel or
       other entity that implements it. There is a race: if the former config‐
       uration completes before the latter, then packets  sent  by  the  local
       host  over  the tunnel can be transmitted in plaintext. Using this set‐
       ting, OVS users can avoid this undesirable situation.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>ipsec_skb_mark</b>: optional string
              This setting takes the form <u>value</u><b>/</b><u>mask</u>. If it is specified, then
              the <b>skb_mark</b> field in every outgoing  tunneled  packet  sent  in
              plaintext  is compared against it and, if it matches, the packet
              is dropped. This is a global setting that is  applied  to  every
              tunneled  packet,  regardless of whether IPsec encryption is en‐
              abled for the tunnel, the type of tunnel, or whether OVS is  in‐
              volved.

              Example policies:

              <b>1/1</b>    Drop all unencrypted tunneled packets in which the least-
                     significant  bit of <b>skb_mark</b> is 1. This would be a useful
                     policy given an OpenFlow flow table that sets <b>skb_mark</b> to
                     1 for traffic  that  should  be  encrypted.  The  default
                     <b>skb_mark</b> is 0, so this would not affect other traffic.

              <b>0/1</b>    Drop all unencrypted tunneled packets in which the least-
                     significant  bit of <b>skb_mark</b> is 0. This would be a useful
                     policy if no unencrypted tunneled traffic should exit the
                     system  without  being  specially  permitted  by  setting
                     <b>skb_mark</b> to 1.

              (empty)
                     If  this  setting is empty or unset, then all unencrypted
                     tunneled packets are transmitted in the usual way.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <u>Core</u> <u>Features:</u>

       <b>name</b>: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Bridge  identifier. Must be unique among the names of ports, in‐
              terfaces, and bridges on a host.

              The name must be alphanumeric and must not  contain  forward  or
              backward  slashes.  The  name of a bridge is also the name of an
              <b>Interface</b> (and a <b>Port</b>) within the bridge, so the restrictions on
              the <b>name</b> column in the <b>Interface</b> table, particularly on  length,
              also  apply  to bridge names. Refer to the documentation for <b>In‐</b>
              <b>terface</b> names for details.

       <b>ports</b>: set of <b>Port</b>s
              Ports included in the bridge.

       <b>mirrors</b>: set of <b>Mirror</b>s
              Port mirroring configuration.

       <b>netflow</b>: optional <b>NetFlow</b>
              NetFlow configuration.

       <b>sflow</b>: optional <b>sFlow</b>
              sFlow(R) configuration.

       <b>ipfix</b>: optional <b>IPFIX</b>
              IPFIX configuration.

       <b>flood_vlans</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              VLAN IDs of VLANs on which MAC address learning should  be  dis‐
              abled, so that packets are flooded instead of being sent to spe‐
              cific  ports  that  are believed to contain packets’ destination
              MACs. This should ordinarily be used to disable MAC learning  on
              VLANs  used  for  mirroring (RSPAN VLANs). It may also be useful
              for debugging.

              SLB bonding (see the <b>bond_mode</b> column in the <b>Port</b> table) is  in‐
              compatible with <b>flood_vlans</b>. Consider using another bonding mode
              or a different type of mirror instead.

       <b>auto_attach</b>: optional <b>AutoAttach</b>
              Auto Attach configuration.

     <u>OpenFlow</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       <b>controller</b>: set of <b>Controller</b>s
              OpenFlow  controller set. If unset, then no OpenFlow controllers
              will be used.

              If there are primary controllers, removing all  of  them  clears
              the OpenFlow flow tables, group table, and meter table. If there
              are no primary controllers, adding one also clears these tables.
              Other  changes  to the set of controllers, such as adding or re‐
              moving a service controller, adding another  primary  controller
              to  supplement  an existing primary controller, or removing only
              one of two primary controllers, have no effect on these tables.

       <b>flow_tables</b>: map of integer-<b>Flow_Table</b> pairs, key in range 0 to 254
              Configuration for OpenFlow tables. Each pair maps from an  Open‐
              Flow table ID to configuration for that table.

       <b>fail_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>secure</b> or <b>standalone</b>
              When  a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible
              for setting up all flows on the switch. Thus, if the  connection
              to  the  controller fails, no new network connections can be set
              up. If the connection to the controller stays down long  enough,
              no  packets can pass through the switch at all. This setting de‐
              termines the switch’s response to such a situation.  It  may  be
              set to one of the following:

              <b>standalone</b>
                     If  no  message is received from the controller for three
                     times  the  inactivity  probe  interval   (see   <b>inactiv‐</b>
                     <b>ity_probe</b>), then Open vSwitch will take over responsibil‐
                     ity  for  setting  up  flows.  In this mode, Open vSwitch
                     causes the bridge to act like  an  ordinary  MAC-learning
                     switch. Open vSwitch will continue to retry connecting to
                     the controller in the background and, when the connection
                     succeeds, it will discontinue its standalone behavior.

              <b>secure</b> Open  vSwitch  will  not set up flows on its own when the
                     controller connection fails or when  no  controllers  are
                     defined.  The bridge will continue to retry connecting to
                     any defined controllers forever.

              The default is <b>standalone</b> if the value is unset, but future ver‐
              sions of Open vSwitch may change the default.

              The <b>standalone</b> mode can create forwarding loops on a bridge that
              has more than one uplink port unless STP is  enabled.  To  avoid
              loops on such a bridge, configure <b>secure</b> mode or enable STP (see
              <b>stp_enable</b>).

              The  <b>fail_mode</b> setting applies only to primary controllers. When
              more than one primary controller  is  configured,  <b>fail_mode</b>  is
              considered  only  when none of the configured controllers can be
              contacted.

              Changing <b>fail_mode</b> when no primary  controllers  are  configured
              clears the OpenFlow flow tables, group table, and meter table.

       <b>datapath_id</b>: optional string
              Reports  the OpenFlow datapath ID in use. Exactly 16 hex digits.
              (Setting this  column  has  no  useful  effect.  Set  <b>other-con‐</b>

              <b>path_id</b> column of the <b>Datapath</b> table. The full documentation for
              this column is there.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>datapath-id</b>: optional string
              Overrides  the  default  OpenFlow datapath ID, setting it to the
              specified value specified in hex. The value must either  have  a
              <b>0x</b> prefix or be exactly 16 hex digits long. May not be all-zero.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dp-desc</b>: optional string
              Human  readable  description  of  datapath.  It is a maximum 256
              byte-long free-form string to describe the datapath  for  debug‐
              ging  purposes, e.g. <b>switch3</b> <b>in</b> <b>room</b> <b>3120</b>. The value is returned
              by  the  switch  as  a  part  of  reply  to  OFPMP_DESC  request
              (ofp_desc).  The  OpenFlow  specification (e.g. 1.3.5) describes
              the  ofp_desc  structure  to  contaion  "NULL  terminated  ASCII
              strings".  For  the compatibility reasons no more than 255 ASCII
              characters should be used.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dp-sn</b>: optional string
              Serial number. It is a maximum 32 byte-long free-form string  to
              provide  an  additional  switch identification. The value is re‐
              turned by the switch as a part of reply  to  OFPMP_DESC  request
              (ofp_desc).  Same  as mentioned in the description of <b>other-con‐</b>

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>controller-queue-size</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 1 to 512
              This sets the maximum size of the queue of packets that need  to
              be sent to the OpenFlow management controller. The value must be
              less than 512. If not specified the queue size is limited to 100

     <u>Spanning</u> <u>Tree</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       The IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that
       ensures  loop-free topologies. It allows redundant links to be included
       in the network to provide automatic backup paths if  the  active  links
       fails.

       These  settings  configure the slower-to-converge but still widely sup‐
       ported  version  of  Spanning  Tree  Protocol,   sometimes   known   as
       802.1D-1998.  Open  vSwitch also supports the newer Rapid Spanning Tree
       Protocol (RSTP), documented later in the section titled <b>Rapid</b>  <b>Spanning</b>
       <b>Tree</b> <b>Configuration</b>.

     <u>STP</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       <b>stp_enable</b>: boolean
              Enable  spanning tree on the bridge. By default, STP is disabled
              on bridges. Bond, internal, and mirror ports are  not  supported
              and will not participate in the spanning tree.

              STP  and  RSTP are mutually exclusive. If both are enabled, RSTP
              will be used.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-system-id</b>: optional string
              The bridge’s STP identifier (the lower 48 bits of the bridge-id)
              in the form <u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>. By default, the identifier is the
              MAC address of the bridge.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-priority</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 65,535
              The bridge’s relative priority value for  determining  the  root
              bridge  (the  upper 16 bits of the bridge-id). A bridge with the
              lowest bridge-id is elected the root. By default,  the  priority
              is 0x8000.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-hello-time</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 1 to 10
              The  interval  between transmissions of hello messages by desig‐
              nated ports, in seconds. By default the hello interval is 2 sec‐
              onds.

       ger, in range 4 to 30
              The delay to wait  between  transitioning  root  and  designated
              ports  to <b>forwarding</b>, in seconds. By default, the forwarding de‐
              lay is 15 seconds.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>mcast-snooping-aging-time</b>: optional string, containing
       an integer, at least 1
              The maximum number of seconds to retain a multicast snooping en‐
              try for which no packets have been seen.  The  default  is  cur‐
              rently  300  seconds  (5  minutes).  The value, if specified, is
              forced into a reasonable range, currently 15 to 3600 seconds.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>mcast-snooping-table-size</b>: optional string, containing

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>mcast-snooping-disable-flood-unregistered</b>: optional
       string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If set to <b>false</b>, unregistered multicast packets are forwarded to
              all  ports.  If  set to <b>true</b>, unregistered multicast packets are
              forwarded to ports connected to multicast routers.

              fer.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp_root_path_cost</b>: optional string
              The  path cost of reaching the designated bridge. A lower number
              is better. The value is 0 if this bridge is the root,  otherwise
              it is higher.

     <u>Rapid</u> <u>Spanning</u> <u>Tree:</u>

       Rapid  Spanning  Tree  Protocol (RSTP), like STP, is a network protocol
       that ensures loop-free topologies. RSTP superseded STP with the  publi‐
       cation of 802.1D-2004. Compared to STP, RSTP converges more quickly and
       recovers more quickly from failures.

     <u>RSTP</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       <b>rstp_enable</b>: boolean
              Enable  Rapid  Spanning  Tree on the bridge. By default, RSTP is
              disabled on bridges. Bond, internal, and mirror  ports  are  not
              supported and will not participate in the spanning tree.

              STP  and  RSTP are mutually exclusive. If both are enabled, RSTP
              will be used.

              The bridge’s relative priority value for  determining  the  root
              bridge  (the  upper 16 bits of the bridge-id). A bridge with the
              lowest bridge-id is elected the root. By default,  the  priority
              is  0x8000  (32768).  This value needs to be a multiple of 4096,
              otherwise it’s rounded to the nearest inferior one.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-ageing-time</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐

              The delay used by STP Bridges to transition Root and  Designated
              Ports to Forwarding. The default value is 15.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-transmit-hold-count</b>: optional string, containing an

              The  Transmit Hold Count used by the Port Transmit state machine
              to limit transmission rate. The default value is 6.

     <u>RSTP</u> <u>Status:</u>

       These key-value pairs  report  the  status  of  802.1D-2004.  They  are

     <u>Multicast</u> <u>Snooping</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       Multicast snooping (RFC 4541) monitors the  Internet  Group  Management
       Protocol  (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery traffic between hosts
       and multicast routers. The switch  uses  what  IGMP  and  MLD  snooping
       learns  to  forward  multicast traffic only to interfaces that are con‐
       nected to interested receivers. Currently it supports  IGMPv1,  IGMPv2,
       IGMPv3, MLDv1 and MLDv2 protocols.

       <b>mcast_snooping_enable</b>: boolean
              Enable multicast snooping on the bridge. For now, the default is
              disabled.

       <b>datapath_type</b>: string
              Name  of datapath provider. The kernel datapath has type <b>system</b>.
              The userspace datapath has type <b>netdev</b>. A manager may  refer  to
              the  <b>datapath_types</b>  column of the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table for a list
              of the types accepted by this Open vSwitch instance.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>bridge-id</b>: optional string
              A unique identifier of the bridge.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>hwaddr</b>: optional string
              An Ethernet address in the form  <u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>  to  set  the
              hardware  address  of  the local port and influence the datapath
              ID.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>forward-bpdu</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Controls forwarding of BPDUs and other  network  control  frames
              when  NORMAL action is invoked. When this option is <b>false</b> or un‐
              set, frames with reserved Ethernet addresses (see  table  below)
              will  not  be  forwarded.  When this option is <b>true</b>, such frames
              will not be treated specially.

              The above general rule has the following exceptions:

              •      If STP is enabled on the bridge (see the <b>stp_enable</b>  col‐
                     umn  in  the  <b>Bridge</b> table), the bridge processes all re‐
                     ceived STP packets and never passes them to  OpenFlow  or
                     forwards them. This is true even if STP is disabled on an
                     individual port.

              •      If  LLDP  is enabled on an interface (see the <b>lldp</b> column
                     in the <b>Interface</b> table), the interface processes received
                     LLDP packets and never passes them to  OpenFlow  or  for‐
                     wards them.

              Set this option to <b>true</b> if the Open vSwitch bridge connects dif‐
              ferent Ethernet networks and is not configured to participate in
              STP.

              This  option  affects packets with the following destination MAC
              addresses:

              The maximum number of seconds to retain a MAC learning entry for
              which no packets have been seen. The default  is  currently  300
              seconds  (5  minutes). The value, if specified, is forced into a
              reasonable range, currently 15 to 3600 seconds.

              A short MAC aging time allows a network to more  quickly  detect
              that a host is no longer connected to a switch port. However, it
              also  makes it more likely that packets will be flooded unneces‐
              sarily, when they are addressed to a connected host that  rarely
              transmits packets. To reduce the incidence of unnecessary flood‐
              ing,  use  a  MAC aging time longer than the maximum interval at

<b>Port</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       A port within a <b>Bridge</b>.

       Most  commonly, a port has exactly one ``interface,’’ pointed to by its
       <b>interfaces</b> column. Such a port logically corresponds to  a  port  on  a
       physical  Ethernet  switch.  A  port  with more than one interface is a
       ``bonded port’’ (see <b>Bonding</b> <b>Configuration</b>).

       Some properties that one might think as belonging to a port  are  actu‐
       ally part of the port’s <b>Interface</b> members.

              and interfaces names are usually the same, the  restrictions  on

              also apply to port names. Refer to the documentation for  <b>Inter‐</b>

              The  port’s  interfaces.  If  there  is more than one, this is a

     <u>VLAN</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       In short, a VLAN (short for ``virtual LAN’’) is a way  to  partition  a
       single switch into multiple switches. VLANs can be confusing, so for an
       introduction,  please  refer  to the question ``What’s a VLAN?’’ in the
       Open vSwitch FAQ.

       A VLAN is sometimes encoded into a packet using  a  802.1Q  or  802.1ad
       VLAN header, but every packet is part of some VLAN whether or not it is
       encoded  in  the packet. (A packet that appears to have no VLAN is part
       of VLAN 0, by default.) As a result, it’s useful to think of a VLAN  as
       a metadata property of a packet, separate from how the VLAN is encoded.
       For  a  given port, this column determines how the encoding of a packet
       that ingresses or egresses the port maps to the packet’s VLAN.  When  a
       packet  enters  the switch, its VLAN is determined based on its setting
       in this column and its VLAN headers, if any,  and  then,  conceptually,
       the VLAN headers are then stripped off. Conversely, when a packet exits
       the  switch,  its  VLAN  and the settings in this column determine what
       VLAN headers, if any, are pushed onto the packet before it egresses the
       port.

       The VLAN configuration in this column affects Open vSwitch only when it
       is doing ``normal switching.’’ It does not affect flows set  up  by  an
       OpenFlow controller, outside of the OpenFlow ``normal action.’’

       Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:

              trunk  A  trunk  port  carries  packets on one or more specified
                     VLANs specified in the <b>trunks</b>  column  (often,  on  every
                     VLAN).  A packet that ingresses on a trunk port is in the
                     VLAN specified in its 802.1Q header, or  VLAN  0  if  the
                     packet  has  no  802.1Q  header.  A  packet that egresses
                     through a trunk port will have an 802.1Q header if it has
                     a nonzero VLAN ID.

                     Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged  with  a
                     VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped.

              access An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN speci‐
                     fied  in  the  <b>tag</b> column. Packets egressing on an access
                     port have no 802.1Q header.

                     Any packet with an 802.1Q header with a nonzero  VLAN  ID
                     that  ingresses  on an access port is dropped, regardless
                     of whether the VLAN ID in the header is the access port’s
                     VLAN ID.

              native-tagged
                     A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with the ex‐
                     ception that a packet without an 802.1Q header  that  in‐
                     gresses on a native-tagged port is in the ``native VLAN’’
                     (specified in the <b>tag</b> column).

              native-untagged
                     A  native-untagged  port  resembles a native-tagged port,
                     with the exception that a packet that egresses on  a  na‐
                     tive-untagged  port  in  the native VLAN will not have an
                     802.1Q header.

              dot1q-tunnel
                     A dot1q-tunnel port is somewhat like an access port. Like
                     an access port, it carries packets  on  the  single  VLAN
                     specified  in  the  <b>tag</b>  column and this VLAN, called the
                     service VLAN, does not appear in  an  802.1Q  header  for
                     packets that ingress or egress on the port. The main dif‐
                     ference  lies in the behavior when packets that include a
                     802.1Q header ingress on the port. Whereas an access port
                     drops such packets, a dot1q-tunnel port treats  these  as
                     double-tagged with the outer service VLAN <b>tag</b> and the in‐
                     ner  customer  VLAN  taken from the 802.1Q header. Corre‐
                     spondingly, to egress on the port, a  packet  outer  VLAN
                     (or  only  VLAN)  must  be  <b>tag</b>,  which is removed before
                     egress, which exposes the inner (customer) VLAN if one is
                     present.

                     If <b>cvlans</b> is set, only allows packets  in  the  specified
                     customer VLANs.

       A  packet  will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of
       the packet, as described by the rules above.

       <b>vlan_mode</b>: optional string, one of <b>access</b>, <b>dot1q-tunnel</b>, <b>native-tagged</b>,
       <b>native-untagged</b>, or <b>trunk</b>
              The VLAN mode of the port, as described above. When this  column

              •      If  <b>tag</b> contains a value, the port is an access port. The
                     <b>trunks</b> column should be empty.

              •      Otherwise, the port is a trunk port.  The  <b>trunks</b>  column
                     value is honored if it is present.

       <b>tag</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095
              For an access port, the port’s implicitly tagged VLAN. For a na‐
              tive-tagged  or  native-untagged  port,  the port’s native VLAN.
              Must be empty if this is a trunk port.

       <b>trunks</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the  802.1Q
              VLAN  or  VLANs  that this port trunks; if it is empty, then the
              port trunks all VLANs. Must be empty if this is an access port.

              A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its native
              VLAN, regardless of whether <b>trunks</b> includes that VLAN.

       <b>cvlans</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              For a dot1q-tunnel port, the customer VLANs that this  port  in‐
              cludes. If this is empty, the port includes all customer VLANs.

              For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>qinq-ethtype</b>: optional string, either <b>802.1ad</b> or <b>802.1q</b>
              For  a  dot1q-tunnel port, this is the TPID for the service tag,
              that is, for the 802.1Q header that contains  the  service  VLAN
              ID.  Because  packets  that actually ingress and egress a dot1q-
              tunnel port do not include an  802.1Q  header  for  the  service
              VLAN,  this does not affect packets on the dot1q-tunnel port it‐
              self. Rather, it determines the service VLAN for a  packet  that
              ingresses on a dot1q-tunnel port and egresses on a trunk port.

              The  value  <b>802.1ad</b> specifies TPID 0x88a8, which is also the de‐
              fault if the setting is omitted. The value <b>802.1q</b> specifies TPID
              0x8100.

              For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>priority-tags</b>: optional string, one of <b>always</b>,
       <b>if-nonzero</b>, or <b>never</b>
              An 802.1Q header contains two important pieces of information: a
              VLAN ID and a priority. A frame with a zero VLAN  ID,  called  a
              ``priority-tagged’’  frame,  is  supposed to be treated the same
              way as a frame without an 802.1Q header at all (except  for  the
              priority).

              However,  some network elements ignore any frame that has 802.1Q
              header at all, even when the VLAN ID is zero. Therefore, by  de‐
              fault  Open  vSwitch does not output priority-tagged frames, in‐
              stead omitting the 802.1Q header entirely  if  the  VLAN  ID  is
              zero.  Set  this  key  to  <b>if-nonzero</b>  to enable priority-tagged
              frames on a port.

              For <b>if-nonzero</b> Open vSwitch omits the 802.1Q header on output if
              both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero. Set  to  <b>always</b>  to
              retain the 802.1Q header in such frames as well.

              All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero VLAN ID,
              so this setting is not meaningful on native-tagged ports.

     <u>Bonding</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       A  port  that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port.’’ Bonding
       allows for load balancing and fail-over.

       The following types of bonding will work  with  any  kind  of  upstream
       switch.  On  the  upstream switch, do not configure the interfaces as a
       bond:

              <b>balance-slb</b>
                     Balances flows among members based on source MAC  address
                     and  output  VLAN,  with  periodic rebalancing as traffic
                     patterns change.

              <b>active-backup</b>
                     Assigns all flows to one member, failing over to a backup
                     member when the active member is disabled.  This  is  the
                     only bonding mode in which interfaces may be plugged into
                     different upstream switches.

       The following modes require the upstream switch to support 802.3ad with
       successful  LACP  negotiation. If LACP negotiation fails and other-con‐
       fig:lacp-fallback-ab is true, then <b>active-backup</b> mode is used:

              <b>balance-tcp</b>
                     Balances flows among members based on L3 and L4  protocol
                     information such as IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports.

       These  columns  apply  only to bonded ports. Their values are otherwise
       ignored.

       <b>bond_mode</b>: optional string, one of <b>active-backup</b>, <b>balance-slb</b>, or <b>bal‐</b>
       <b>ance-tcp</b>
              The type of bonding used for a  bonded  port.  Defaults  to  <b>ac‐</b>
              <b>tive-backup</b> if unset.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>bond-hash-basis</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              An  integer hashed along with flows when choosing output members
              in load balanced bonds. When changed, all flows will be assigned
              different hash values possibly causing  member  selection  deci‐
              sions  to change. Does not affect bonding modes which do not em‐
              ploy load balancing such as <b>active-backup</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lb-output-action</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Enable/disable usage of optimized <b>lb_output</b> action for balancing
              flows among output  members  in  load  balanced  bonds  in  <b>bal‐</b>
              <b>ance-tcp</b>.  When  enabled, it uses optimized path for balance-tcp
              mode by using rss hash and avoids recirculation. This knob  does
              not affect other balancing modes.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>bond-primary</b>: optional string
              If  a  member interface with this name exists in the bond and is
              up, it will  be  made  active.  Relevant  only  when  <b>other_con‐</b>
              <b>fig:bond_mode</b>  is  <b>active-backup</b> or if <b>balance-tcp</b> falls back to
              <b>active-backup</b>  (e.g.,  LACP  negotiation  fails  and  <b>other_con‐</b>
              <b>fig:lacp-fallback-ab</b> is <b>true</b>).

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>all-members-active</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              Enable/Disable  delivery  of broadcast/multicast packets on sec‐
              ondary interface of a balance-slb bond. Relevant only when  <b>lacp</b>
              is <b>off</b>.

              This  parameter is identical to <b>all_slaves_active</b> for Linux ker‐
              nel bonds. Disabled by default as it is not a desirable configu‐
              ration for most users.

     <u>Link</u> <u>Failure</u> <u>Detection:</u>

       An important part of link bonding is detecting that links are  down  so
       that  they  may  be disabled. These settings determine how Open vSwitch
       detects link failure.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>bond-detect-mode</b>: optional string, either <b>carrier</b> or <b>mi‐</b>
       <b>imon</b>
              The means used to detect  link  failures.  Defaults  to  <b>carrier</b>
              which uses each interface’s carrier to detect failures. When set
              to  <b>miimon</b>,  will check for failures by polling each interface’s
              MII.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>bond-miimon-interval</b>: optional string, containing an in‐
       teger
              The interval, in milliseconds, between  successive  attempts  to
              poll each interface’s MII. Relevant only when <b>other_config:bond-</b>
              <b>detect-mode</b> is <b>miimon</b>.

       <b>bond_updelay</b>: integer
              The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay up on an
              interface before the interface is considered to be up. Specify <b>0</b>
              to enable the interface immediately.

              This  setting is honored only when at least one bonded interface
              is already enabled. When no interfaces  are  enabled,  then  the
              first bond interface to come up is enabled immediately.

       <b>bond_downdelay</b>: integer
              The  number of milliseconds for which the link must stay down on
              an interface before the interface  is  considered  to  be  down.
              Specify <b>0</b> to disable the interface immediately.

     <u>LACP</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       LACP,  the  Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE standard that
       allows switches to automatically detect that they are connected by mul‐
       tiple links and aggregate across those links.  These  settings  control
       LACP behavior.

       <b>lacp</b>: optional string, one of <b>active</b>, <b>off</b>, or <b>passive</b>
              Configures  LACP  on  this  port. LACP allows directly connected
              switches to negotiate which links may be bonded. LACP may be en‐
              abled on non-bonded ports for the benefit of any  switches  they
              may  be  connected to. <b>active</b> ports are allowed to initiate LACP
              negotiations. <b>passive</b> ports are allowed to participate  in  LACP
              negotiations  initiated  by  a remote switch, but not allowed to
              initiate such negotiations themselves. If LACP is enabled  on  a
              port  whose  partner switch does not support LACP, the bond will
              be disabled,  unless  other-config:lacp-fallback-ab  is  set  to
              true. Defaults to <b>off</b> if unset.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-system-id</b>: optional string
              The LACP system ID of this <b>Port</b>. The system ID of a LACP bond is
              used  to  identify itself to its partners. Must be a nonzero MAC
              address. Defaults to the bridge Ethernet address if unset.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-system-priority</b>: optional string, containing an in‐
       teger, in range 1 to 65,535
              The LACP system priority of this  <b>Port</b>.  In  LACP  negotiations,
              link  status  decisions  are made by the system with the numeri‐
              cally lower priority.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-time</b>: optional string, either <b>fast</b> or <b>slow</b>
              The LACP timing which should be used on this  <b>Port</b>.  By  default
              <b>slow</b> is used. When configured to be <b>fast</b> LACP heartbeats are re‐
              quested  at a rate of once per second causing connectivity prob‐
              lems to be detected more quickly. In <b>slow</b> mode,  heartbeats  are
              requested at a rate of once every 30 seconds.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-fallback-ab</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Determines the behavior of openvswitch bond in LACP mode. If the
              partner  switch  does  not  support LACP, setting this option to
              <b>true</b> allows openvswitch to fallback to active-backup. If the op‐
              tion is set to <b>false</b>, the bond will be  disabled.  In  both  the
              cases,  once  the partner switch is configured to LACP mode, the
              bond will use LACP.

     <u>Rebalancing</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       These settings control behavior when a bond is in <b>balance-slb</b>  or  <b>bal‐</b>
       <b>ance-tcp</b> mode.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>bond-rebalance-interval</b>: optional string, containing an
       integer, in range 0 to 2,147,483,647
              For  a load balanced bonded port, the number of milliseconds be‐
              tween successive attempts to rebalance the  bond,  that  is,  to
              move  flows  from one interface on the bond to another in an at‐
              tempt to keep usage of each interface roughly  equal.  If  zero,
              load balancing is disabled on the bond (link failure still cause
              flows to move). If less than 1000ms, the rebalance interval will
              be 1000ms.

       <b>bond_fake_iface</b>: boolean
              For  a  bonded port, whether to create a fake internal interface
              with the name of the  port.  Use  only  for  compatibility  with
              legacy software that requires this.

     <u>Spanning</u> <u>Tree</u> <u>Protocol:</u>

       The configuration here is only meaningful, and the status is only popu‐
       lated, when 802.1D-1998 Spanning Tree Protocol is enabled on the port’s
       <b>Bridge</b> with its <b>stp_enable</b> column.

     <u>STP</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              When STP is enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default on all
              of  the  bridge’s  ports except bond, internal, and mirror ports
              (which do not work with STP). If this column’s value  is  <b>false</b>,
              STP is disabled on the port.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-port-num</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 255
              The port number used for the lower 8 bits of the port-id. By de‐
              fault, the numbers will be assigned automatically. If any port’s
              number  is  manually  configured on a bridge, then they must all
              be.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-port-priority</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 0 to 255
              The port’s relative priority value for determining the root port
              (the upper 8 bits of the port-id). A port with a  lower  port-id
              will  be  chosen  as  the root port. By default, the priority is
              0x80.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp-path-cost</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 0 to 65,535
              Spanning tree path cost for the port. A lower number indicates a
              faster link. By default, the cost is based on the maximum  speed
              of the link.

     <u>STP</u> <u>Status:</u>

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp_port_id</b>: optional string
              The  port ID used in spanning tree advertisements for this port,
              as 4 hex digits. Configuring the port ID  is  described  in  the
              <b>stp-port-num</b> and <b>stp-port-priority</b> keys of the <b>other_config</b> sec‐
              tion earlier.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>blocking</b>, <b>disabled</b>, <b>for‐</b>
       <b>warding</b>, <b>learning</b>, or <b>listening</b>
              STP state of the port.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp_sec_in_state</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              The  amount of time this port has been in the current STP state,
              in seconds.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>stp_role</b>: optional string, one of <b>alternate</b>, <b>designated</b>, or
       <b>root</b>
              STP role of the port.

     <u>Rapid</u> <u>Spanning</u> <u>Tree</u> <u>Protocol:</u>

       The configuration here is only meaningful, and the status  and  statis‐
       tics are only populated, when 802.1D-1998 Spanning Tree Protocol is en‐
       abled on the port’s <b>Bridge</b> with its <b>stp_enable</b> column.

     <u>RSTP</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              When  RSTP  is  enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default on
              all of the bridge’s ports  except  bond,  internal,  and  mirror
              ports  (which  do not work with RSTP). If this column’s value is
              <b>false</b>, RSTP is disabled on the port.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-port-priority</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 0 to 240
              The port’s relative priority  value  for  determining  the  root
              port,  in multiples of 16. By default, the port priority is 0x80
              (128). Any value in the lower 4 bits is rounded off. The signif‐
              icant upper 4 bits become the upper 4 bits  of  the  port-id.  A
              port with the lowest port-id is elected as the root.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-port-num</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       in range 1 to 4,095
              The  local  RSTP  port  number, used as the lower 12 bits of the
              port-id. By default the port numbers are assigned automatically,
              and typically may not correspond to the OpenFlow port numbers. A
              port with the lowest port-id is elected as the root.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-path-cost</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The port path cost. The Port’s contribution, when it is the Root
              Port, to the Root Path Cost for the Bridge. By default the  cost
              is automatically calculated from the port’s speed.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-port-admin-edge</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              The admin edge port parameter for the Port. Default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-port-auto-edge</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              The auto edge port parameter for the Port. Default is <b>true</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp-port-mcheck</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              The mcheck port parameter for the Port. Default is <b>false</b>. May be
              set to force the Port Protocol Migration state machine to trans‐
              mit  RST BPDUs for a MigrateTime period, to test whether all STP
              Bridges on the attached LAN have been removed and the  Port  can
              continue to transmit RSTP BPDUs. Setting mcheck has no effect if
              the Bridge is operating in STP Compatibility mode.

              Changing  the  value from <b>true</b> to <b>false</b> has no effect, but needs
              to be done if this behavior is to be triggered again  by  subse‐
              quently changing the value from <b>false</b> to <b>true</b>.

     <u>RSTP</u> <u>Status:</u>

       <b>rstp_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp_port_id</b>: optional string
              The  port ID used in spanning tree advertisements for this port,
              as 4 hex digits. Configuring the port ID  is  described  in  the
              <b>rstp-port-num</b>  and  <b>rstp-port-priority</b>  keys of the <b>other_config</b>
              section earlier.

              RSTP role of the port.

       <b>rstp_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>rstp_port_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>Disabled</b>, <b>Dis‐</b>

   <b>Details:</b>
     <u>Core</u> <u>Features:</u>

       <b>name</b>: immutable string (must be unique within table)
              Interface  name.  Should  be  alphanumeric. For non-bonded port,
              this should be the same as the port name. It must  otherwise  be
              unique  among  the  names of ports, interfaces, and bridges on a
              host.

              The maximum length of an interface name depends on the  underly‐
              ing datapath:

              •      The names of interfaces implemented as Linux and BSD net‐
                     work  devices,  including  interfaces with type <b>internal</b>,
                     <b>tap</b>, or <b>system</b> plus the different types of tunnel  ports,
                     are  limited  to  15 bytes. Windows limits these names to
                     255 bytes.

              •      The names of patch ports are not used in  the  underlying
                     datapath,  so operating system restrictions do not apply.
                     Thus, they may have arbitrary length.

              Regardless of other restrictions, OpenFlow only supports 15-byte
              names, which means that <b>ovs-ofctl</b> and OpenFlow controllers  will
              show names truncated to 15 bytes.

       <b>ifindex</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A  positive  interface  index as defined for SNMP MIB-II in RFCs
              1213 and 2863, if  the  interface  has  one,  otherwise  0.  The
              ifindex  is  useful for seamless integration with protocols such
              as SNMP and sFlow.

       <b>mac_in_use</b>: optional string
              The MAC address in use by this interface.

       <b>mac</b>: optional string
              Ethernet address to set for this interface. If  unset  then  the
              default MAC address is used:

              •      For  the  local interface, the default is the lowest-num‐
                     bered MAC address among the other  bridge  ports,  either
                     the  value  of the <b>mac</b> in its <b>Port</b> record, if set, or its
                     actual MAC (for bonded ports, the MAC of its member whose
                     name is first in alphabetical order). Internal ports  and
                     bridge ports that are used as port mirroring destinations
                     (see the <b>Mirror</b> table) are ignored.

              •      For  other  internal  interfaces, the default MAC is ran‐
                     domly generated.

              •      External interfaces typically have a MAC address  associ‐
                     ated with their hardware.

              Some  interfaces  may  not  have a software-controllable MAC ad‐
              dress. This option only affects internal ports. For  other  type
              ports,  you can change the MAC address outside Open vSwitch, us‐
              ing ip command.

       <b>error</b>: optional string
              If the configuration of the port failed, as indicated by  -1  in
              <b>ofport</b>, Open vSwitch sets this column to an error description in
              human readable form. Otherwise, Open vSwitch clears this column.

     <u>OpenFlow</u> <u>Port</u> <u>Number:</u>

       When  a  client  adds a new interface, Open vSwitch chooses an OpenFlow
       port number for the new port. If the client that adds the port fills in
       <b>ofport_request</b>, then Open vSwitch tries to use its value as  the  Open‐
       Flow port number. Otherwise, or if the requested port number is already
       in use or cannot be used for another reason, Open vSwitch automatically
       assigns  a  free port number. Regardless of how the port number was ob‐
       tained, Open vSwitch then reports in <b>ofport</b> the  port  number  actually
       assigned.

       Open  vSwitch  limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to
       the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive. Controllers therefore have  free
       use of ports 32,768 and up.

       <b>ofport</b>: optional integer
              OpenFlow  port number for this interface. Open vSwitch sets this
              column’s value, so other clients should treat it as read-only.

              The OpenFlow ``local’’ port (<b>OFPP_LOCAL</b>) is  65,534.  The  other
              valid  port  numbers  are  in  the range 1 to 65,279, inclusive.
              Value -1 indicates an error adding the interface.

       <b>ofport_request</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 65,279
              Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface.

              A client should ideally set this  column’s  value  in  the  same
              database  transaction that it uses to create the interface. Open
              vSwitch version 2.1 and later will honor a later request  for  a
              specific  port  number,  althuogh  it  might  confuse  some con‐
              trollers: OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number
              change, so Open vSwitch represents it over OpenFlow  as  a  port
              deletion followed immediately by a port addition.

              If  <b>ofport_request</b>  is set or changed to some other port’s auto‐
              matically assigned port number, Open vSwitch chooses a new  port
              number for the latter port.

     <u>System-Specific</u> <u>Details:</u>

       <b>type</b>: string
              The interface type. The types supported by a particular instance
              of  Open  vSwitch  are  listed  in the <b>iface_types</b> column in the
              <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. The following types are defined:

              <b>system</b> An ordinary network device, e.g. <b>eth0</b> on Linux. Sometimes
                     referred to as ``external  interfaces’’  since  they  are
                     generally connected to hardware external to that on which
                     the  Open  vSwitch is running. The empty string is a syn‐
                     onym for <b>system</b>.

              <b>internal</b>
                     A simulated network device that sends and receives  traf‐
                     fic.  An internal interface whose <b>name</b> is the same as its
                     bridge’s <b>name</b> is called the ``local interface.’’ It  does
                     not  make  sense  to  bond  an internal interface, so the
                     terms ``port’’ and ``interface’’ are  often  used  impre‐
                     cisely for internal interfaces.

              <b>tap</b>    A TUN/TAP device managed by Open vSwitch.

                     Open vSwitch checks the interface state before send pack‐
                     ets  to  the  device.  When  it  is <b>down</b>, the packets are
                     dropped and the tx_dropped statistic is  updated  accord‐
                     ingly.  Older  versions of Open vSwitch did not check the
                     interface state and then the tx_packets  was  incremented
                     along with tx_dropped.

              <b>geneve</b> An             Ethernet            over            Geneve
                     (<b>http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nvo3-geneve</b>)
                     IPv4/IPv6 tunnel. A description of how to match  and  set
                     Geneve options can be found in the <b>ovs-ofctl</b> manual page.

              <b>gre</b>    Generic  Routing  Encapsulation  (GRE)  over IPv4 tunnel,
                     configurable to encapsulate layer 2 or layer 3 traffic.

              <b>ip6gre</b> Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over IPv6 tunnel, en‐
                     capsulate layer 2 traffic.

              <b>vxlan</b>  An Ethernet tunnel over the UDP-based VXLAN protocol  de‐
                     scribed in RFC 7348.

                     Open  vSwitch  uses  IANA-assigned  UDP  destination port
                     4789. The source port used for VXLAN traffic varies on  a
                     per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral port range.

              <b>patch</b>  A pair of virtual devices that act as a patch cable.

              <b>gtpu</b>   GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is a group of IP-based com‐
                     munications  protocols used to carry general packet radio
                     service (GPRS) within GSM, UMTS and LTE  networks.  GTP-U
                     is  used for carrying user data within the GPRS core net‐
                     work and between the radio access network  and  the  core
                     network.  The user data transported can be packets in any
                     of IPv4, IPv6, or PPP formats.

                     The protocol is documented at http://www.3gpp.org/DynaRe‐
                     port/29281.htm

                     Open vSwitch uses UDP destination port 2152.  The  source
                     port  used for GTP traffic varies on a per-flow basis and
                     is in the ephemeral port range.

              <b>Bareudp</b>
                     The Bareudp tunnel provides a  generic  L3  encapsulation
                     support  for tunnelling different L3 protocols like MPLS,
                     IP, NSH etc. inside a UDP tunnel.

              <b>srv6</b>   Segment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) tunnel encapsulates L3  traf‐
                     fic  as  "IPv6  in  IPv6"  or "IPv4 in IPv6" with Segment
                     Routing Header (SRH) defined in  RFC  8754.  The  segment
                     list in SRH can be set using a SRv6 specific option.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u>

       These  options  apply  to interfaces with <b>type</b> of <b>geneve</b>, <b>bareudp</b>, <b>gre</b>,
       <b>ip6gre</b>, <b>vxlan</b>, and <b>srv6</b>.

       Each tunnel must be uniquely identified by the combination of <b>type</b>, <b>op‐</b>
       <b>tions:remote_ip</b>, <b>options:local_ip</b>, and <b>options:in_key</b>. If two ports are
       defined that are the same except one has an optional identifier and the
       other does not, the more specific one is matched first.  <b>options:in_key</b>
       is considered more specific than <b>options:local_ip</b> if a port defines one
       and  another  port  defines the other. <b>options:in_key</b> is not applicable
       for bareudp and srv6 tunnels. Hence it is not considered while  identi‐
       fying bareudp or srv6 tunnels.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>remote_ip</b>: optional string
              Required. The remote tunnel endpoint, one of:

              •      An   IPv4   or  IPv6  address  (not  a  DNS  name),  e.g.
                     <b>192.168.0.123</b>. Only unicast endpoints are supported.

              •      The word <b>flow</b>. The tunnel accepts packets from any remote
                     tunnel endpoint. To process only packets from a  specific
                     remote tunnel endpoint, the flow entries may match on the
                     <b>tun_src</b>  or  <b>tun_ipv6_src</b>field. When sending packets to a
                     <b>remote_ip=flow</b> tunnel, the flow actions  must  explicitly
                     set  the  <b>tun_dst</b> or <b>tun_ipv6_dst</b> field to the IP address
                     of the  desired  remote  tunnel  endpoint,  e.g.  with  a
                     <b>set_field</b> action.

              The remote tunnel endpoint for any packet received from a tunnel
              is  available  in the <b>tun_src</b> field for matching in the flow ta‐
              ble.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>local_ip</b>: optional string
              Optional. The tunnel destination IP that received  packets  must
              match.  Default  is to match all addresses. If specified, may be
              one of:

              •      An IPv4/IPv6 address (not a DNS name), e.g. <b>192.168.12.3</b>.

              •      The word <b>flow</b>. The tunnel accepts packets sent to any  of
                     the  local  IP  addresses  of  the system running OVS. To
                     process only packets sent to a specific IP  address,  the
                     flow  entries  may  match  on the <b>tun_dst</b> or <b>tun_ipv6_dst</b>
                     field. When sending packets to  a  <b>local_ip=flow</b>  tunnel,
                     the  flow  actions  may  explicitly  set  the  <b>tun_src</b> or
                     <b>tun_ipv6_src</b> field to the desired IP address, e.g. with a
                     <b>set_field</b> action. However,  while  routing  the  tunneled
                     packet  out,  the local system may override the specified
                     address with the local IP address configured for the out‐
                     going system interface.

                     This option is valid only  for  tunnels  also  configured
                     with the <b>remote_ip=flow</b> option.

              The tunnel destination IP address for any packet received from a
              tunnel  is  available  in  the <b>tun_dst</b> or <b>tun_ipv6_dst</b> field for
              matching in the flow table.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>in_key</b>: optional string
              Optional, not applicable for <b>bareudp</b> and <b>srv6</b>. The key that  re‐
              ceived packets must contain, one of:

              •      <b>0</b>.  The tunnel receives packets with no key or with a key
                     of 0. This is equivalent to specifying no  <b>options:in_key</b>
                     at all.

              •      A  positive  24-bit (for Geneve and VXLAN) or 32-bit (for
                     GRE) number. The tunnel receives only  packets  with  the
                     specified key.

              •      The  word  <b>flow</b>. The tunnel accepts packets with any key.
                     The key will be placed in the <b>tun_id</b> field  for  matching
                     in the flow table. The <b>ovs-fields</b>(7) manual page contains
                     additional  information about matching fields in OpenFlow
                     flows.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>out_key</b>: optional string
              Optional, not applicable for <b>bareudp</b> and <b>srv6</b>. The key to be set
              on outgoing packets, one of:

              •      <b>0</b>. Packets sent through the tunnel will have no key. This
                     is equivalent to specifying no <b>options:out_key</b> at all.

              •      A positive 24-bit (for Geneve and VXLAN) or  32-bit  (for

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>dst_port</b>: optional string
              Optional.  The  tunnel transport layer destination port, for UDP
              based tunnel protocols (Geneve, VXLAN).

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>key</b>: optional string
              Optional. Shorthand to set <b>in_key</b> and <b>out_key</b> at the same time.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>tos</b>: optional string
              Optional. The value of the ToS bits to be set on the encapsulat‐
              ing packet. ToS is interpreted as DSCP and ECN  bits,  ECN  part
              must be zero. It may also be the word <b>inherit</b>, in which case the
              ToS  will  be copied from the inner packet if it is IPv4 or IPv6
              (otherwise it will be 0). The ECN fields are  always  inherited.
              Default is 0.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>ttl</b>: optional string
              Optional.  The TTL to be set on the encapsulating packet. It may
              also be the word <b>inherit</b>, in which case the TTL will  be  copied
              from  the  inner packet if it is IPv4 or IPv6 (otherwise it will
              be the system default, typically 64). Default is the system  de‐
              fault TTL.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>df_default</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Optional. If enabled, the Don’t Fragment bit will be set on tun‐
              nel  outer  headers  to allow path MTU discovery. Default is en‐
              abled; set to <b>false</b> to disable.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>egress_pkt_mark</b>: optional string
              Optional. The pkt_mark to be set on  the  encapsulating  packet.
              This  option  sets  packet  mark for the tunnel endpoint for all
              tunnel packets including tunnel monitoring.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>vxlan</u> <u>only:</u>

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>exts</b>: optional string
              Optional. Comma separated list of optional VXLAN  extensions  to

              •      <b>gbp</b>:  VXLAN-GBP allows to transport the group policy con‐
                     text of a packet across the VXLAN tunnel to other network

                     Without  this  option, a VXLAN packet always encapsulates
                     an Ethernet frame. With this option, an VXLAN packet  may
                     also encapsulate an IPv4, IPv6, NSH, or MPLS packet.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>packet_type</b>: optional string, one of <b>legacy_l2</b>, <b>legacy_l3</b>, or
       <b>ptap</b>
              This  option controls what types of packets the tunnel sends and
              receives and how it represents them:

              •      By default, or if this option is  <b>legacy_l2</b>,  the  tunnel
                     sends and receives only Ethernet frames.

              •      If  this  option  is  <b>legacy_l3</b>, the tunnel sends and re‐
                     ceives only non-Ethernet (L3) packet, but the packets are
                     represented as Ethernet  frames  for  compatibility  with
                     legacy  OpenFlow  controllers  that expect this behavior.
                     This requires enabling <b>gpe</b> in <b>options:exts</b>.

              •      If this option is <b>ptap</b>, Open vSwitch  represents  packets
                     in  the tunnel using the <b>packet_type</b> mechanism introduced
                     in OpenFlow 1.5. This  mechanism  supports  any  kind  of
                     packet,  but  actually sending and receiving non-Ethernet
                     packets  requires  additionally  enabling  <b>gpe</b>   in   <b>op‐</b>
                     <b>tions:exts</b>.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>gre</u> <u>only:</u>

       <b>gre</b> interfaces support these options.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>packet_type</b>: optional string, one of <b>legacy_l2</b>, <b>legacy_l3</b>, or
       <b>ptap</b>
              This  option controls what types of packets the tunnel sends and
              receives and how it represents them:

              •      By default, or if this option is  <b>legacy_l2</b>,  the  tunnel
                     sends and receives only Ethernet frames.

              •      If  this  option  is  <b>legacy_l3</b>, the tunnel sends and re‐
                     ceives only non-Ethernet (L3) packet, but the packets are
                     represented as Ethernet  frames  for  compatibility  with
                     legacy OpenFlow controllers that expect this behavior.

              •      The <b>legacy_l3</b> option is only available via the user space
                     datapath.  The  OVS  kernel datapath does not support de‐
                     vices of type ARPHRD_IPGRE which is the  requirement  for
                     <b>legacy_l3</b> type packets.

              •      If this option is <b>ptap</b>, the tunnel sends and receives any
                     kind  of  packet.  Open vSwitch represents packets in the
                     tunnel using  the  <b>packet_type</b>  mechanism  introduced  in
                     OpenFlow 1.5.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>seq</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Optional.  A  4-byte  sequence number field for GRE tunnel only.
              Default is disabled, set to <b>true</b> to enable. Sequence  number  is
              incremented by one on each outgoing packet.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>gre,</u> <u>ip6gre,</u> <u>geneve,</u> <u>bareudp</u> <u>and</u> <u>vxlan:</u>

       <b>gre</b>,  <b>ip6gre</b>,  <b>geneve</b>,  <b>bareudp</b>  and <b>vxlan</b> interfaces support these op‐
       tions.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>csum</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Optional. Compute  encapsulation  header  (either  GRE  or  UDP)
              checksums  on  outgoing packets. When unset (the default value),
              checksum computing for outgoing packets is enabled for UDP  IPv6
              tunnels,  and disabled for GRE and IPv4 UDP tunnels. When set to
              <b>false</b>, no checksums will be computed for outgoing tunnel  encap‐
              sulation  headers. When <b>true</b>, checksums will be computed for all
              outgoing tunnel encapsulation headers. Checksums present on  in‐
              coming packets will be validated regardless of this setting. In‐
              coming  packets without a checksum will also be accepted regard‐
              less of this setting.

              When using the upstream  Linux  kernel  module,  computation  of
              checksums for <b>geneve</b> and <b>vxlan</b> requires Linux kernel version 4.0
              or  higher. <b>gre</b> and <b>ip6gre</b> support checksums for all versions of
              Open vSwitch that support GRE. The out  of  tree  kernel  module
              distributed  as  part of OVS can compute all tunnel checksums on
              any kernel version that it is compatible with.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>IPsec:</u>

       Setting any of these options enables IPsec support for a given  tunnel.
       <b>gre</b>,  <b>geneve</b>  and <b>vxlan</b> interfaces support these options. See the <b>IPsec</b>
       section in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table for a description of each mode.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>psk</b>: optional string
              In PSK mode only, the preshared secret to negotiate tunnel. This
              value must match on both tunnel ends.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>remote_cert</b>: optional string
              In self-signed certificate mode only, name of a  PEM  file  con‐
              taining a certificate of the remote switch. The certificate must
              be  x.509 version 3 and with the string in common name (CN) also
              set in the subject alternative name (SAN).

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>remote_name</b>: optional string
              In CA-signed certificate mode only, common name (CN) of the  re‐
              mote certificate.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>erspan</u> <u>only:</u>

       Only <b>erspan</b> interfaces support these options.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>erspan_idx</b>: optional string
              20  bit  index/port  number associated with the ERSPAN traffic’s
              source port and direction (ingress/egress). This field is  plat‐
              form dependent.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>erspan_ver</b>: optional string
              ERSPAN  version:  1  for  version 1 (type II) or 2 for version 2
              (type III).

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>erspan_dir</b>: optional string
              Specifies the ERSPAN v2  mirrored  traffic’s  direction.  1  for
              egress traffic, and 0 for ingress traffic.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>erspan_hwid</b>: optional string
              ERSPAN  hardware ID is a 6-bit unique identifier of an ERSPAN v2
              engine within a system.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>Bareudp</u> <u>only:</u>

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>payload_type</b>: optional string
              Specifies the ethertype of the l3 protocol the bareudp device is
              tunnelling. For the tunnels which supports  multiple  ethertypes
              of  a  l3  protocol (IP, MPLS) this field specifies the protocol
              name as a string.

     <u>Tunnel</u> <u>Options:</u> <u>srv6</u> <u>only:</u>

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>srv6_segs</b>: optional string
              Specifies the segment list in Segment Routing Header  (SRH).  It
              consists  of  a  comma-separated list of segments represented in
              IPv6 format,  e.g.  "fc00:100::1,fc00:200::1,fc00:300::1".  Note
              that the first segment must be the same as <b>options:remote_ip</b>.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>srv6_flowlabel</b>: optional string, one of <b>compute</b>, <b>copy</b>, or
       <b>zero</b>
              Optional.  This  option  controls  how  flowlabel  in outer IPv6
              header is configured. It gives the benefit of  IPv6  flow  label
              based  load balancing, which is supported by some popular vendor
              appliances. Like net.ipv6.seg6_flowlabel sysconfig, it is one of
              the three values below:

              •      By default, or if this option is <b>copy</b>, copy the flowlabel
                     of inner IPv6 header  to  the  flowlabel  of  outer  IPv6
                     header. If inner header is not IPv6, it is set to 0.

              •      If this option is <b>zero</b>, simply set flowlabel to 0.

              •      If  this  option is <b>compute</b>, set flowlabel to a hash over
                     the L3/L4 fields of the inner packet.

     <u>Patch</u> <u>Options:</u>

       These options apply only to <u>patch</u> <u>ports</u>, that is, interfaces whose <b>type</b>
       column is <b>patch</b>. Patch ports are mainly a way to connect otherwise  in‐
       dependent bridges to one another, similar to how one might plug an Eth‐
       ernet  cable  (a ``patch cable’’) into two physical switches to connect
       those switches. The effect of plugging a patch port into  two  switches
       is  conceptually  similar  to  that of plugging the two ends of a Linux
       <b>veth</b> device into those switches, but the implementation of patch  ports
       makes them much more efficient.

       Patch  ports  may connect two different bridges (the usual case) or the
       same bridge. In the latter case, take special care to avoid loops, e.g.
       by programming appropriate flows with OpenFlow. Patch ports do not work
       if its ends are attached to bridges on  different  datapaths,  e.g.  to
       connect bridges in <b>system</b> and <b>netdev</b> datapaths.

       The  following  command  creates and connects patch ports <b>p0</b> and <b>p1</b> and
       adds them to bridges <b>br0</b> and <b>br1</b>, respectively:

       <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br0</b> <b>p0</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>p0</b> <b>type=patch</b> <b>options:peer=p1</b> <b>\</b>
              <b>--</b> <b>add-port</b> <b>br1</b> <b>p1</b> <b>--</b> <b>set</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>p1</b> <b>type=patch</b> <b>options:peer=p0</b>


       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>peer</b>: optional string
              The <b>name</b> of the <b>Interface</b> for the other side of the  patch.  The
              named  <b>Interface</b>’s own <b>peer</b> option must specify this <b>Interface</b>’s
              name. That is, the two patch interfaces must have reversed  <b>name</b>
              and <b>peer</b> values.

     <u>PMD</u> <u>(Poll</u> <u>Mode</u> <u>Driver)</u> <u>Options:</u>

       Only PMD netdevs support these options.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>n_rxq</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              Specifies  the maximum number of rx queues to be created for PMD
              netdev. If not specified or specified to 0, one rx queue will be
              created by default. Not supported by DPDK vHost interfaces.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-devargs</b>: optional string
              Specifies the PCI address associated with the port for  physical
              devices,  or  the  virtual driver to be used for the port when a
              virtual PMD is intended to be used. For the latter, the argument
              string typically takes the form of <b>eth_</b><u>driver</u><b>_</b><u>namex</u>, where  <u>dri‐</u>
              <u>ver</u><b>_</b><u>name</u>  is  a  valid  virtual  DPDK PMD driver name and <u>x</u> is a
              unique identifier of your choice for the given port.  Only  sup‐
              ported by the dpdk port type.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>pmd-rxq-affinity</b>: optional string
              Specifies mapping of RX queues of this interface to CPU cores.

              Value should be set in the following form:

              <b>other_config:pmd-rxq-affinity=&lt;rxq-affinity-list&gt;</b>

              where

              •      &lt;rxq-affinity-list&gt; ::= NULL | &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;non-empty-list&gt;  ::= &lt;affinity-pair&gt; | &lt;affinity-pair&gt; ,
                     &lt;non-empty-list&gt;

              •      &lt;affinity-pair&gt; ::= &lt;queue-id&gt; : &lt;core-id&gt;

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>xdp-mode</b>: optional string, one of <b>best-effort</b>, <b>generic</b>, <b>na‐</b>
       <b>tive-with-zerocopy</b>, or <b>native</b>
              Specifies the operational mode of the XDP program.

              In <b>native-with-zerocopy</b> mode the XDP program is loaded into  the
              device  driver  with  zero-copy RX and TX enabled. This mode re‐
              quires device driver support and has the  best  performance  be‐
              cause there should be no copying of packets.

              <b>native</b>  is  the  same as <b>native-with-zerocopy</b>, but without zero-
              copy capability. This requires at least one copy between  kernel
              and  the  userspace. This mode also requires support from device
              driver.

              In <b>generic</b> case the XDP program in kernel works after skb  allo‐
              cation  on  early stages of packet processing inside the network
              stack. This mode doesn’t require driver support,  but  has  much
              lower performance.

              <b>best-effort</b>  tries  to detect and choose the best (fastest) from
              the available modes for current interface.

              Note that this option is specific to netdev-afxdp.  Defaults  to
              <b>best-effort</b> mode.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>use-need-wakeup</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Specifies whether to use need_wakeup feature in afxdp netdev. If
              enabled,  OVS  explicitly  wakes  up the kernel RX, using poll()
              syscall and wakes up TX, using sendto()  syscall.  For  physical
              devices,  this  feature improves the performance by avoiding un‐
              necessary sendto syscalls. Defaults  to  true  if  supported  by
              libbpf.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>vhost-server-path</b>: optional string
              The  value  specifies  the  path to the socket associated with a
              vHost User client mode device that has been or will  be  created
              by QEMU. Only supported by dpdkvhostuserclient interfaces.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>vhost-max-queue-pairs</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 1 to 128
              The  value specifies the maximum number of queue pairs supported
              by a vHost device. This is ignored for vhost-user backends, only
              VDUSE is supported. Only supported by dpdkvhostuserclient inter‐
              faces.

              Default value is 1.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>tx-retries-max</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 0 to 32
              The value specifies the maximum amount of vhost tx retries  that
              can be made while trying to send a batch of packets to an inter‐
              face. Only supported by dpdkvhostuserclient interfaces.

              Default value is 8.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>n_rxq_desc</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least
       1
              Specifies  the  rx  queue  size (number rx descriptors) for dpdk
              ports. The value must be a power of 2 and supported by the hard‐
              ware of the device being configured. If not specified or an  in‐
              correct  value is specified, 2048 rx descriptors will be used by
              default.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>n_txq_desc</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least
       1
              Specifies the tx queue size (number  tx  descriptors)  for  dpdk
              ports. The value must be a power of 2 and supported by the hard‐
              ware  of the device being configured. If not specified or an in‐
              correct value is specified, 2048 tx descriptors will be used  by
              default.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>dpdk-vf-mac</b>: optional string
              Ethernet address to set for this VF interface. If unset then the
              default MAC address is used:

              •      For  most  drivers,  the  default MAC address assigned by
                     their hardware.

              •      For bifurcated drivers, the MAC  currently  used  by  the
                     kernel netdevice.

              This option may only be used with dpdk VF representors.

       <b>options</b> <b>:</b> <b>rx-steering</b>: optional string, either <b>rss+lacp</b> or <b>rss</b>
              Configure hardware Rx queue steering policy.

              This option takes one of the following values:

              <b>rss</b>    Distribution  of ingress packets in all Rx queues accord‐
                     ing to the RSS algorithm. This is the default behaviour.

              <b>rss+lacp</b>
                     Distribution of ingress packets according to the RSS  al‐
                     gorithm  on  all but the last Rx queue. An extra Rx queue
                     is allocated for LACP packets.

              If the user has already configured multiple <b>options:n_rxq</b> on the
              port, an additional one will be allocated for the specified pro‐
              tocols. Even if the hardware cannot satisfy the requested number
              of requested Rx queues, the last Rx queue will be used. If  only
              one  Rx  queue  is available or if the hardware does not support
              the rte_flow matchers/actions required to redirect the  selected
              protocols,  custom  <b>rx-steering</b>  will  fall  back to default <b>rss</b>
              mode.

              This feature is mutually exclusive with  <b>other_config:hw-offload</b>
              as  it  may  conflict  with the offloaded flows. If both are en‐
              abled, <b>rx-steering</b> will fall back to default <b>rss</b> mode.

              This option is only applicable to interfaces with type <b>dpdk</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>tx-steering</b>: optional string, either <b>hash</b> or <b>thread</b>
              Specifies the Tx steering mode for the interface.

              <b>thread</b> enables static (1:1) thread-to-txq mapping when the  num‐
              ber  of Tx queues is greater than number of PMD threads, and dy‐
              namic (N:1) mapping if equal or lower. In  this  mode  a  single
              thread can not use more than 1 transmit queue of a given port.

              <b>hash</b> enables hash-based Tx steering, which distributes the pack‐
              ets on all the transmit queues based on their 5-tuples hashes.

              Defaults to <b>thread</b>.

     <u>EMC</u> <u>(Exact</u> <u>Match</u> <u>Cache)</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       These settings controls behaviour of EMC lookups/insertions for packets
       received from the interface.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>emc-enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Specifies  if  Exact Match Cache (EMC) should be used while pro‐
              cessing  packets  received  from  this   interface.   If   true,
              <b>other_config:emc-insert-inv-prob</b> will have effect on this inter‐
              face.

              Defaults to true.

     <u>MTU:</u>

       The  MTU (maximum transmission unit) is the largest amount of data that
       can fit into a single Ethernet frame. The standard Ethernet MTU is 1500
       bytes. Some physical media and many kinds of virtual interfaces can  be
       configured with higher MTUs.

       A  client  may  change an interface MTU by filling in <b>mtu_request</b>. Open
       vSwitch then reports in <b>mtu</b> the currently configured value.

       <b>mtu</b>: optional integer
              The currently configured MTU for the interface.

              This column will be empty for an interface that does not have an
              MTU as, for example, some kinds of tunnels do not.

              Open vSwitch sets this column’s value, so other  clients  should
              treat it as read-only.

       <b>mtu_request</b>: optional integer, at least 1
              Requested  MTU  (Maximum Transmission Unit) for the interface. A
              client can fill this column to change the MTU of an interface.

              RFC 791 requires every internet module to be able to  forward  a
              datagram of 68 octets without further fragmentation. The maximum
              size of an IP packet is 65535 bytes.

              If  this is not set and if the interface has <b>internal</b> type, Open
              vSwitch will change the MTU to match the minimum  of  the  other
              interfaces in the bridge.

     <u>Interface</u> <u>Status:</u>

       Status  information about interfaces attached to bridges, updated every
       5 seconds. Not all interfaces have all of these properties; virtual in‐
       terfaces don’t have a link speed, for example.  Non-applicable  columns
       will have empty values.

       <b>admin_state</b>: optional string, either <b>down</b> or <b>up</b>
              The administrative state of the physical network link.

       <b>link_state</b>: optional string, either <b>down</b> or <b>up</b>
              The  observed  state of the physical network link. This is ordi‐
              narily the link’s carrier status. If the interface’s <b>Port</b>  is  a
              bond configured for miimon monitoring, it is instead the network
              link’s miimon status.

       <b>link_resets</b>: optional integer
              The  number of times Open vSwitch has observed the <b>link_state</b> of
              this <b>Interface</b> change.

       <b>link_speed</b>: optional integer
              The negotiated speed of the physical network link. Valid  values
              are positive integers greater than 0.

       <b>duplex</b>: optional string, either <b>full</b> or <b>half</b>
              The duplex mode of the physical network link.

              Boolean  value  indicating  LACP  status  for this interface. If
              true, this interface has current LACP information about its LACP
              partner. This information may be used to monitor the  health  of
              interfaces  in a LACP enabled port. This column will be empty if
              LACP is not enabled.

       <b>status</b>: map of string-string pairs
              Key-value pairs that report port status. Supported status values
              are <b>type</b>-dependent; some interfaces may not have  a  valid  <b>sta‐</b>
              <b>tus:driver_name</b>, for example.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>driver_name</b>: optional string
              The name of the device driver controlling the network adapter.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>driver_version</b>: optional string

              The version string of the network adapter’s firmware, if  avail‐
              able.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>source_ip</b>: optional string
              The  source  IP  address used for an IPv4/IPv6 tunnel end-point,
              such as <b>gre</b>.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>tunnel_egress_iface</b>: optional string
              Egress interface for tunnels. Currently only relevant  for  tun‐
              nels on Linux systems, this column will show the name of the in‐
              terface  which  is  responsible for routing traffic destined for
              the configured <b>options:remote_ip</b>. This could be an internal  in‐
              terface such as a bridge port.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>tunnel_egress_iface_carrier</b>: optional string, either <b>down</b> or
       <b>up</b>
              Whether carrier is detected on <b>status:tunnel_egress_iface</b>.

              of possible values.

     <u>Statistics:</u>

       Key-value pairs that report interface statistics. The current implemen‐
       tation updates these counters periodically. The update period  is  con‐
       trolled  by  <b>other_config:stats-update-interval</b> in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> ta‐
       ble. Future implementations may update them when an interface  is  cre‐
       ated, when they are queried (e.g. using an OVSDB <b>select</b> operation), and
       just before an interface is deleted due to virtual interface hot-unplug
       or  VM shutdown, and perhaps at other times, but not on any regular pe‐
       riodic basis.

       These are the same  statistics  reported  by  OpenFlow  in  its  <b>struct</b>
       <b>ofp_port_stats</b> structure. If an interface does not support a given sta‐
       tistic, then that pair is omitted.

     <u>Statistics:</u> <u>Successful</u> <u>transmit</u> <u>and</u> <u>receive</u> <u>counters:</u>

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>rx_packets</b>: optional integer
              Number of received packets.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>rx_bytes</b>: optional integer

     <u>Statistics:</u> <u>Receive</u> <u>errors:</u>

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>rx_dropped</b>: optional integer
              Number of packets dropped by RX.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>rx_frame_err</b>: optional integer

              Total number of receive errors, greater than or equal to the sum
              of the above.

     <u>Statistics:</u> <u>Transmit</u> <u>errors:</u>

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>tx_dropped</b>: optional integer
              Number of packets dropped by TX.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>collisions</b>: optional integer
              Number of collisions.

       <b>statistics</b> <b>:</b> <b>tx_errors</b>: optional integer
              Total  number  of  transmit errors, greater than or equal to the
              sum of the above.

     <u>Ingress</u> <u>Policing:</u>

       These settings control ingress policing for packets  received  on  this
       interface. On a physical interface, this limits the rate at which traf‐
       fic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a virtual interface
       (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at which the
       VM is able to transmit.

       Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops pack‐
       ets  received  in excess of the configured rate. Due to its simplicity,
       policing is usually less accurate and less effective  than  egress  QoS
       (which is configured using the <b>QoS</b> and <b>Queue</b> tables).

       Policing  settings  can  be set with byte rate or packet rate, and they
       can be configured together, in which case they  take  effect  together,
       that means the smaller speed limit of them is in effect.

       Currently,  byte  rate  policing  is  implemented on Linux and OVS with
       DPDK, while packet rate policing is only  implemented  on  Linux.  Both
       Linux  and  OVS  DPDK implementations use a simple ``token bucket’’ ap‐
       proach.

       Byte rate policing:

              •      The size of  the  bucket  corresponds  to  <b>ingress_polic‐</b>
                     <b>ing_burst</b>. Initially the bucket is full.

              •      Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted to to‐
                     kens)  is  compared  to the number of tokens currently in
                     the bucket. If the required number of tokens  are  avail‐
                     able,  they are removed and the packet is forwarded. Oth‐
                     erwise, the packet is dropped.

              •      Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with  to‐
                     kens at the rate specified by <b>ingress_policing_rate</b>.

       Packet rate policing:

              •      The  size  of  the  bucket  corresponds to <b>ingress_polic‐</b>
                     <b>ing_kpkts_burst</b>. Initially the bucket is full.

              •      Whenever a packet is received, it will consume one  token
                     from the current bucket. If the token is available in the
                     bucket,  it’s removed and the packet is forwarded. Other‐
                     wise, the packet is dropped.

              •      Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with  to‐
                     kens   at  the  rate  specified  by  <b>ingress_policing_kp‐</b>
                     <b>kts_rate</b>.

       Policing interacts badly with some network  protocols,  and  especially
       with fragmented IP packets. Suppose that there is enough network activ‐
       ity  to  keep  the  bucket  nearly  empty all the time. Then this token
       bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with  the
       period  depending on packet size and on the configured rate. All of the
       fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as  a
       group. In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments will
       be  forwarded and the rest will be dropped. IP does not provide any way
       for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining fragments.  In
       such  a  case  there  are two likely possibilities for what will happen
       next: either all of the fragments will eventually be retransmitted  (as
       TCP  will do), in which case the same problem will recur, or the sender
       will not realize that its packet has been dropped and data will  simply
       be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do). Either way, it is possi‐
       ble that no forward progress will ever occur.

       <b>ingress_policing_rate</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum  rate for data received on this interface, in kbps. Data
              received faster than this rate is dropped. Set  to  <b>0</b>  (the  de‐
              fault) to disable policing.

       <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_rate</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum  rate  for  data  received on this interface, in kpps (1
              kpps is 1000 pps).  Data  received  faster  than  this  rate  is
              dropped. Set to <b>0</b> (the default) to disable policing.

       <b>ingress_policing_burst</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum  burst  size for data received on this interface, in kb.
              The default burst size if set to <b>0</b> is 8000 kbit. This value  has
              no effect if <b>ingress_policing_rate</b> is <b>0</b>.

              Specifying  a  larger burst size lets the algorithm be more for‐
              giving, which is important for protocols like TCP that react se‐
              verely to dropped packets. The burst size should be at least the
              size of the interface’s MTU. Specifying a value that is  numeri‐
              cally  at  least  as large as 80% of <b>ingress_policing_rate</b> helps
              TCP come closer to achieving the full rate.

       <b>ingress_policing_kpkts_burst</b>: integer, at least 0
              Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in kpkts
              (1 kpkts is 1000 packets). The default burst size if set to <b>0</b> is
              16 kpkts. This  value  has  no  effect  if  <b>ingress_policing_kp‐</b>
              <b>kts_rate</b> is <b>0</b>.

              Specifying  a  larger burst size lets the algorithm be more for‐
              giving, which is important for protocols like TCP that react se‐
              verely to dropped packets. Specifying a value  that  is  numeri‐

     <u>Bidirectional</u> <u>Forwarding</u> <u>Detection</u> <u>(BFD):</u>

       BFD, defined in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881, allows point-to-point  detection
       of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control mes‐
       sages. Open vSwitch implements BFD to serve as a more popular and stan‐
       dards compliant alternative to CFM.

       BFD  operates  by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a rate
       negotiated independently in each direction. Each endpoint specifies the
       rate at which it expects to receive control messages, and the  rate  at
       which  it  is willing to transmit them. By default, Open vSwitch uses a
       detection multiplier of three, meaning that an endpoint signals a  con‐
       nectivity  fault  if three consecutive BFD control messages fail to ar‐
       rive. In the case of a unidirectional connectivity  issue,  the  system
       not  receiving  BFD control messages signals the problem to its peer in
       the messages it transmits.

       The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply  faithfully  with
       RFC 5880 requirements. Open vSwitch does not implement the optional Au‐
       thentication or ``Echo Mode’’ features.

       OVS  2.13  and  earlier  intercepted and processed all BFD packets. OVS
       2.14 and later only intercept and process BFD  packets  destined  to  a
       configured  BFD  instance,  and other BFD packets are made available to
       the OVS flow table for forwarding.

     <u>BFD</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       A controller sets up key-value pairs in the <b>bfd</b> column  to  enable  and
       configure BFD.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>enable</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True to enable BFD on this <b>Interface</b>. If not specified, BFD will
              not be enabled by default.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>min_rx</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              The  shortest  interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD ses‐
              sion offers to receive BFD control messages. The remote endpoint
              may choose to send messages at a slower rate. Defaults to <b>1000</b>.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>min_tx</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1
              The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this  BFD  ses‐
              sion  is willing to transmit BFD control messages. Messages will
              actually be transmitted at a slower rate if the remote  endpoint
              is  not  willing to receive as quickly as specified. Defaults to
              <b>100</b>.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>decay_min_rx</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              An alternate receive interval, in  milliseconds,  that  must  be
              greater than or equal to <b>bfd:min_rx</b>. The implementation switches
              from <b>bfd:min_rx</b> to <b>bfd:decay_min_rx</b> when there is no obvious in‐
              coming  data  traffic  at  the  interface, to reduce the CPU and
              bandwidth cost of monitoring an idle interface. This feature may
              be disabled by setting a value of 0. This feature is reset when‐
              ever <b>bfd:decay_min_rx</b> or <b>bfd:min_rx</b> changes.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>forwarding_if_rx</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, traffic received on the <b>Interface</b> is used to indicate
              the capability of packet I/O.  BFD  control  packets  are  still
              transmitted  and  received. At least one BFD control packet must
              be received every 100 * <b>bfd:min_rx</b> amount  of  time.  Otherwise,
              even if traffic are received, the <b>bfd:forwarding</b> will be <b>false</b>.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>cpath_down</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Set  to  true  to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should
              not be forwarded to this system for some  reason  other  than  a
              connectivty  failure on the interface being monitored. The typi‐
              cal underlying reason is ``concatenated path  down,’’  that  is,
              that  connectivity  beyond the local system is down. Defaults to
              false.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>check_tnl_key</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Set to true to make BFD accept only control messages with a tun‐
              nel key of zero. By default, BFD accepts control  messages  with
              any tunnel key.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>bfd_local_src_mac</b>: optional string
              Set  to an Ethernet address in the form <u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u> to set
              the MAC used as source for transmitted BFD packets. The  default
              is the mac address of the BFD enabled interface.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>bfd_local_dst_mac</b>: optional string
              Set  to an Ethernet address in the form <u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u> to set
              the MAC used as destination for transmitted BFD packets. The de‐
              fault is <b>00:23:20:00:00:01</b>.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>bfd_remote_dst_mac</b>: optional string
              Set to an Ethernet address in the form <u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u> to  set
              the  MAC used for checking the destination of received BFD pack‐
              ets. Packets with different destination MAC will not be  consid‐
              ered  as  BFD  packets. If not specified the destination MAC ad‐
              dress of received BFD packets are not checked.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>bfd_src_ip</b>: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as source  for
              transmitted BFD packets. The default is <b>169.254.1.1</b>.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>bfd_dst_ip</b>: optional string
              Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as destination
              for transmitted BFD packets. The default is <b>169.254.1.0</b>.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>oam</b>: optional string
              Some  tunnel  protocols  (such  as  Geneve) include a bit in the
              header to indicate that the encapsulated packet is an OAM frame.
              By setting this to true, BFD packets will be marked  as  OAM  if
              encapsulated in one of these tunnels.

       <b>bfd</b> <b>:</b> <b>mult</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 255
              The  BFD  detection multiplier, which defaults to 3. An endpoint
              signals a connectivity fault if the given number of  consecutive
              BFD control messages fail to arrive.

     <u>BFD</u> <u>Status:</u>

       The  switch sets key-value pairs in the <b>bfd_status</b> column to report the
       status of BFD on this interface. When BFD is not enabled, with  <b>bfd:en‐</b>
       <b>able</b>, the switch clears all key-value pairs from <b>bfd_status</b>.

       <b>bfd_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>state</b>: optional string, one of <b>admin_down</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>init</b>, or
       <b>up</b>
              Reports  the  state of the BFD session. The BFD session is fully
              healthy and negotiated if <b>UP</b>.

       <b>bfd_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>forwarding</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              Reports whether the BFD session believes this <b>Interface</b>  may  be
              used  to forward traffic. Typically this means the local session
              is signaling <b>UP</b>, and the remote system isn’t signaling a problem
              such as concatenated path down.

       <b>bfd_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>diagnostic</b>: optional string
              A diagnostic code specifying the local system’s reason  for  the
              last  change in session state. The error messages are defined in
              section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       <b>bfd_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>remote_state</b>: optional string, one of <b>admin_down</b>, <b>down</b>,
       <b>init</b>, or <b>up</b>
              Reports the state of the remote endpoint’s BFD session.

       <b>bfd_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>remote_diagnostic</b>: optional string
              A diagnostic code specifying the remote system’s reason for  the
              last  change in session state. The error messages are defined in
              section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

       <b>bfd_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>flap_count</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              Counts the number of <b>bfd_status:forwarding</b> flaps since start.  A
              flap  is  considered  as  a  change of the <b>bfd_status:forwarding</b>
              value.

     <u>Connectivity</u> <u>Fault</u> <u>Management:</u>

       802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) allows a group  of  Mainte‐
       nance Points (MPs) called a Maintenance Association (MA) to detect con‐
       nectivity  problems  with  each other. MPs within a MA should have com‐
       plete and exclusive interconnectivity. This is verified by occasionally
       broadcasting Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) at a configurable  trans‐
       mission interval.

       According  to  the 802.1ag specification, each Maintenance Point should
       be configured out-of-band with a list of Remote Maintenance  Points  it
       should  have  connectivity to. Open vSwitch differs from the specifica‐
       tion in this area. It simply assumes the link is faulted if  no  Remote
       Maintenance  Points  are reachable, and considers it not faulted other‐
       wise.

       When operating over tunnels which have no <b>in_key</b>, or an <b>in_key</b> of <b>flow</b>.
       CFM will only accept CCMs with a tunnel key of zero.

       <b>cfm_mpid</b>: optional integer
              A Maintenance Point ID (MPID) uniquely identifies each  endpoint
              within  a  Maintenance Association. The MPID is used to identify
              this endpoint to other Maintenance Points in the MA. Each end of
              a link being monitored should have a  different  MPID.  Must  be
              configured to enable CFM on this <b>Interface</b>.

              According to the 802.1ag specification, MPIDs can only range be‐
              tween   [1,   8191].  However,  extended  mode  (see  <b>other_con‐</b>
              <b>fig:cfm_extended</b>) supports eight byte MPIDs.

       <b>cfm_flap_count</b>: optional integer
              Counts the number of cfm fault flapps since boot. A flap is con‐
              sidered to be a change of the <b>cfm_fault</b> value.

       <b>cfm_fault</b>: optional boolean
              Indicates a connectivity fault triggered by an inability to  re‐
              ceive heartbeats from any remote endpoint. When a fault is trig‐
              gered  on  <b>Interface</b>s  participating in bonds, they will be dis‐
              abled.

              Faults can be triggered for several  reasons.  Most  importantly
              they are triggered when no CCMs are received for a period of 3.5
              times  the transmission interval. Faults are also triggered when
              any CCMs indicate that a Remote Maintenance Point is not receiv‐
              ing CCMs but able to send them. Finally, a fault is triggered if
              a CCM is received which indicates unexpected configuration.  No‐
              tably,  this case arises when a CCM is received which advertises
              the local MPID.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>recv</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to a lack  of  CCMs  re‐
              ceived on the <b>Interface</b>.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>rdi</b>: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault was triggered due to the reception of a
              CCM with the RDI bit flagged. Endpoints set the RDI bit in their
              CCMs when they are not receiving CCMs themselves. This typically
              indicates a unidirectional connectivity failure.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>maid</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the  reception  of  a
              CCM with a MAID other than the one Open vSwitch uses. CFM broad‐
              casts  are  tagged  with an identification number in addition to
              the MPID called the MAID. Open vSwitch only  supports  receiving
              CCM broadcasts tagged with the MAID it uses internally.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>loopback</b>: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault was triggered due to the reception of a
              CCM advertising the same MPID configured in the <b>cfm_mpid</b>  column
              of this <b>Interface</b>. This may indicate a loop in the network.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>overflow</b>: none
              Indicates  a  CFM fault was triggered because the CFM module re‐
              ceived CCMs from more remote endpoints than it  can  keep  track
              of.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>override</b>: none
              Indicates a CFM fault was manually triggered by an administrator
              using an <b>ovs-appctl</b> command.

       <b>cfm_fault_status</b> <b>:</b> <b>interval</b>: none
              Indicates  a  CFM  fault was triggered due to the reception of a
              CCM frame having an invalid interval.

       <b>cfm_remote_opstate</b>: optional string, either <b>down</b> or <b>up</b>
              When in extended mode, indicates the operational  state  of  the
              remote  endpoint  as either <b>up</b> or <b>down</b>. See <b>other_config:cfm_op‐</b>
              <b>state</b>.

       <b>cfm_health</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 100
              Indicates the health of the interface as  a  percentage  of  CCM
              frames  received  over 21 <b>other_config:cfm_interval</b>s. The health
              of an interface is undefined if it is  communicating  with  more
              than  one <b>cfm_remote_mpids</b>. It reduces if healthy heartbeats are
              not received at the expected rate,  and  gradually  improves  as
              healthy  heartbeats  are  received at the desired rate. Every 21
              <b>other_config:cfm_interval</b>s, the health of the interface  is  re‐
              freshed.

              As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for several rea‐
              sons.  The  link  health will deteriorate even if heartbeats are
              received but they are reported to  be  unhealthy.  An  unhealthy
              heartbeat  in  this context is a heartbeat for which either some
              fault is set or is out of sequence. The interface health can  be
              100 only on receiving healthy heartbeats at the desired rate.

       <b>cfm_remote_mpids</b>: set of integers
              When  CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will occasionally
              receive CCM broadcasts. These broadcasts contain the MPID of the
              sending Maintenance Point. The list of MPIDs from which this <b>In‐</b>
              <b>terface</b> is receiving broadcasts from is regularly collected  and
              written to this column.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cfm_interval</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The  interval,  in  milliseconds,  between  transmissions of CFM
              heartbeats. Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate a connec‐
              tivity fault.

              In standard operation only  intervals  of  3,  10,  100,  1,000,
              10,000,  60,000,  or 600,000 ms are supported. Other values will
              be rounded down to the nearest value on the list. Extended  mode
              (see  <b>other_config:cfm_extended</b>)  supports  any  interval  up to
              65,535 ms. In either mode, the default is 1000 ms.

              We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cfm_extended</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, the CFM module operates in extended mode. This causes
              it to use a nonstandard destination address to avoid conflicting
              with compliant implementations which may be running concurrently
              on the network. Furthermore, extended mode increases  the  accu‐
              racy  of  the  <b>cfm_interval</b>  configuration parameter by breaking
              wire compatibility with 802.1ag compliant  implementations.  And
              extended mode allows eight byte MPIDs. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cfm_demand</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              When <b>true</b>, and <b>other_config:cfm_extended</b> is true, the CFM module
              operates  in  demand mode. When in demand mode, traffic received
              on the <b>Interface</b> is used to indicate liveness.  CCMs  are  still
              transmitted  and  received.  At  least  one CCM must be received
              every 100 * <b>other_config:cfm_interval</b> amount of time. Otherwise,
              even if traffic are received, the CFM module will raise the con‐
              nectivity fault.

              Demand mode has a couple of caveats:

              •      To ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull  sta‐
                     tistics  from  the datapath, the fault detection interval
                     is set to 3.5 * MAX(<b>other_config:cfm_interval</b>, 500) ms.

              •      To avoid ambiguity,  demand  mode  disables  itself  when
                     there are multiple remote maintenance points.

              •      If  the  <b>Interface</b>  is heavily congested, CCMs containing
                     the <b>other_config:cfm_opstate</b> status may be dropped  caus‐
                     ing changes in the operational state to be delayed. Simi‐
                     larly,  if  CCMs containing the RDI bit are not received,
                     unidirectional link failures may not be detected.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cfm_opstate</b>: optional string, either <b>down</b> or <b>up</b>
              When <b>down</b>, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as  opera‐
              tionally  down  without  triggering  a fault. This allows remote
              maintenance points to choose not to forward traffic to  the  <b>In‐</b>
              <b>terface</b>  on which this CFM module is running. Currently, in Open
              vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects <b>Interface</b>s participating
              in bonds, and the bundle OpenFlow action. This  setting  is  ig‐
              nored when CFM is not in extended mode. Defaults to <b>up</b>.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cfm_ccm_vlan</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 4,095
              When  set,  the  CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to all CCMs it
              generates with the given value. May  be  the  string  <b>random</b>  in
              which  case  each  CCM  will be tagged with a different randomly
              generated VLAN.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cfm_ccm_pcp</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 7
              When set, the CFM module will apply a VLAN tag to  all  CCMs  it
              generates  with  the  given PCP value, the VLAN ID of the tag is
              governed  by  the   value   of   <b>other_config:cfm_ccm_vlan</b>.   If
              <b>other_config:cfm_ccm_vlan</b> is unset, a VLAN ID of zero is used.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-port-id</b>: optional string, containing an integer, in
       range 1 to 65,535
              The  LACP  port  ID of this <b>Interface</b>. Port IDs are used in LACP
              negotiations to identify individual  ports  participating  in  a
              bond.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-port-priority</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, in range 1 to 65,535
              The  LACP  port priority of this <b>Interface</b>. In LACP negotiations
              <b>Interface</b>s with numerically lower priorities are  preferred  for
              aggregation.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>lacp-aggregation-key</b>: optional string, containing an in‐

              The LACP aggregation key of this <b>Interface</b>. <b>Interface</b>s with dif‐
              ferent aggregation keys may not be active within a given <b>Port</b> at
              the same time.

       These  key-value  pairs  specifically apply to an interface that repre‐
       sents a virtual Ethernet interface  connected  to  a  virtual  machine.
       These  key-value  pairs should not be present for other types of inter‐
       faces. Keys whose names end in <b>-uuid</b> have values that uniquely identify
       the entity in question.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>attached-mac</b>: optional string
              The MAC address programmed into  the  ``virtual  hardware’’  for
              this interface, in the form <u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>:<u>xx</u>.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>iface-id</b>: optional string
              A system-unique identifier for the interface.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>iface-status</b>: optional string, either <b>active</b> or <b>inactive</b>
              Hypervisors  may  sometimes have more than one interface associ‐
              ated with a given <b>external_ids:iface-id</b>, only one  of  which  is
              actually  in  use  at a given time. For example, in some circum‐
              stances hypervisor may have both a ``tap’’ and a ``vif’’  inter‐
              face  for  a  single <b>external_ids:iface-id</b>, but only uses one of
              them at a time. A hypervisor that behaves this way must mark the
              currently in use interface <b>active</b> and the others <b>inactive</b>. A hy‐
              pervisor that never has more than one interface for a given  <b>ex‐</b>
              <b>ternal_ids:iface-id</b>  may  mark that interface <b>active</b> or omit <b>ex‐</b>
              <b>ternal_ids:iface-status</b> entirely.

              During VM migration, a given <b>external_ids:iface-id</b>  might  tran‐
              siently  be marked <b>active</b> on two different hypervisors. That is,
              <b>active</b> means that this <b>external_ids:iface-id</b> is the  active  in‐
              stance within a single hypervisor, not in a broader scope. There
              is  one exception: some hypervisors support ``migration’’ from a
              given hypervisor to itself (most often for test purposes).  Dur‐
              ing  such  a  ``migration,’’  two  instances  of a single <b>exter‐</b>
              <b>nal_ids:iface-id</b> might both be briefly marked <b>active</b> on a single
              hypervisor.

       <b>external_ids</b> <b>:</b> <b>vm-id</b>: optional string

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>name</b>: optional string
              The table’s name. Set this column to change the name  that  con‐
              trollers  will  receive when they request table statistics, e.g.
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b> <b>dump-tables</b>. The name does not affect switch behavior.

     <u>Eviction</u> <u>Policy:</u>

       Open vSwitch supports limiting the number of  flows  that  may  be  in‐
       stalled  in a flow table, via the <b>flow_limit</b> column. When adding a flow
       would exceed this limit, by default Open vSwitch reports an error,  but
       there  are  two  ways  to  configure  Open  vSwitch  to  instead delete
       (``evict’’) a flow to make room for the new one:

              •      Set the <b>overflow_policy</b> column to <b>evict</b>.

              •      Send an OpenFlow 1.4+ ``table  mod  request’’  to  enable
                     eviction for the flow table (e.g. <b>ovs-ofctl</b> <b>-O</b> <b>OpenFlow14</b>
                     <b>mod-table</b>  <b>br0</b> <b>0</b> <b>evict</b> to enable eviction on flow table 0
                     of bridge <b>br0</b>).

       When a flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict is  cho‐
       sen through an approximation of the following algorithm. This algorithm
       is used regardless of how eviction was enabled:

              1.  Divide  the flows in the table into groups based on the val‐
                  ues of the fields or subfields specified in the <b>groups</b>  col‐
                  umn, so that all of the flows in a given group have the same
                  values  for those fields. If a flow does not specify a given
                  field, that field’s value is treated  as  0.  If  <b>groups</b>  is
                  empty,  then  all of the flows in the flow table are treated
                  as a single group.

              2.  Consider the flows in the largest group, that is, the  group
                  that  contains  the greatest number of flows. If two or more
                  groups all have the same largest number of  flows,  consider
                  the flows in all of those groups.

              3.  If  the  flows under consideration have different importance
                  values, eliminate from consideration any flows except  those
                  with  the lowest importance. (``Importance,’’ a 16-bit inte‐
                  ger value attached to each flow, was introduced in  OpenFlow
                  1.4.  Flows  inserted with older versions of OpenFlow always
                  have an importance of 0.)

              4.  Among the flows under consideration, choose  the  flow  that
                  expires soonest for eviction.

       The  eviction process only considers flows that have an idle timeout or
       a hard timeout. That is, eviction never deletes permanent flows.  (Per‐
       manent flows do count against <b>flow_limit</b>.)

       <b>flow_limit</b>: optional integer, at least 0
              If  set, limits the number of flows that may be added to the ta‐
              ble. Open vSwitch may limit the number of flows in a  table  for
              other  reasons, e.g. due to hardware limitations or for resource
              availability or performance reasons.

       <b>overflow_policy</b>: optional string, either <b>evict</b> or <b>refuse</b>
              Controls the switch’s behavior when an OpenFlow flow table modi‐
              fication request would add flows in excess  of  <b>flow_limit</b>.  The
              supported values are:

              <b>refuse</b> Refuse to add the flow or flows. This is also the default
                     policy when <b>overflow_policy</b> is unset.

              <b>evict</b>  Delete a flow chosen according to the algorithm described
                     above.

       <b>groups</b>: set of strings
              When  <b>overflow_policy</b> is <b>evict</b>, this controls how flows are cho‐
              sen for eviction when the  flow  table  would  otherwise  exceed
              <b>flow_limit</b>  flows.  Its  value  is  a  set of NXM fields or sub-
              fields, each  of  which  takes  one  of  the  forms  <u>field</u><b>[]</b>  or
              <u>field</u><b>[</b><u>start</u><b>..</b><u>end</u><b>]</b>, e.g. <b>NXM_OF_IN_PORT[]</b>. Please see <b>meta-flow.h</b>
              for a complete list of NXM field names.

              Open  vSwitch  ignores  any  invalid or unknown field specifica‐
              tions.

              When eviction is not enabled, via <b>overflow_policy</b> or an OpenFlow
              1.4+ ``table mod,’’ this column has no effect.

     <u>Classifier</u> <u>Optimization:</u>

       <b>prefixes</b>: set of up to 4 strings
              This string set specifies which fields should be  used  for  ad‐
              dress  prefix tracking. Prefix tracking allows the classifier to
              skip rules with longer than  necessary  prefixes,  resulting  in
              better wildcarding for datapath flows.

              Prefix  tracking  may  be  beneficial when a flow table contains
              matches on IP address fields with different prefix lengths.  For
              example,  when  a flow table contains IP address matches on both
              full addresses and proper prefixes,  the  full  address  matches
              will  typically cause the datapath flow to un-wildcard the whole
              address field (depending on flow entry priorities). In this case
              each packet with a different address gets handed  to  the  user‐
              space  for  flow processing and generates its own datapath flow.
              With prefix tracking enabled for the address field  in  question
              packets  with addresses matching shorter prefixes would generate
              datapath flows where the irrelevant address bits are wildcarded,
              allowing the same datapath flow to handle all the packets within
              the prefix in question. In this case many userspace upcalls  can
              be avoided and the overall performance can be better.

              This is a performance optimization only, so packets will receive
              the same treatment with or without prefix tracking.

              The    supported   fields   are:   <b>tun_id</b>,   <b>tun_src</b>,   <b>tun_dst</b>,
              <b>tun_ipv6_src</b>, <b>tun_ipv6_dst</b>, <b>nw_src</b>, <b>nw_dst</b>  (or  aliases  <b>ip_src</b>
              and  <b>ip_dst</b>),  <b>ipv6_src</b>,  and  <b>ipv6_dst</b>. (Using this feature for
              <b>tun_id</b> would only make sense  if  the  tunnel  IDs  have  prefix
              structure similar to IP addresses.)

              By  default,  the  <b>prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src,ipv6_dst,ipv6_src</b>  are
              used on each flow table. This instructs the flow  classifier  to
              track the IPv4 and IPv6 destination and source addresses used by
              the rules in this specific flow table.

              The  keyword  <b>none</b>  is recognized as an explicit override of the
              default values, causing no prefix fields to be tracked.

              To set the prefix fields, the flow table record needs to exist:

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>flow_tables:0=@N1</b> <b>--</b> <b>--id=@N1</b> <b>create</b>
              <b>Flow_Table</b> <b>name=table0</b>
                     Creates a flow table record for the OpenFlow table number
                     0.

              <b>ovs-vsctl</b> <b>set</b> <b>Flow_Table</b> <b>table0</b> <b>prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src</b>
                     Enables prefix tracking for IPv4 source  and  destination
                     address fields.

              There  is a maximum number of fields that can be enabled for any
              one flow table. Currently this limit is 4.

                     Linux  ``No operation.’’ By default, Open vSwitch manages
                     quality of service on all of its configured  ports.  This
                     can  be  helpful,  but sometimes administrators prefer to
                     use other software to manage QoS. This <b>type</b> prevents Open
                     vSwitch from changing the QoS configuration for a port.

              <b>egress-policer</b>
                     A DPDK egress policer algorithm using the DPDK  rte_meter
                     library. The rte_meter library provides an implementation
                     which  allows  the  metering and policing of traffic. The
                     implementation in OVS essentially creates a single  token
                     bucket  used  to  police traffic. It should be noted that
                     when the rte_meter is configured as  part  of  QoS  there
                     will  be  a  performance overhead as the rte_meter itself
                     will consume CPU cycles in order to police traffic. These
                     CPU cycles ordinarily are used for packet proccessing. As
                     such the drop in performance will be noticed in terms  of
                     overall aggregate traffic throughput.

              <b>trtcm-policer</b>
                     A  DPDK  egress  policer  algorithm using RFC 4115’s Two-
                     Rate, Three-Color marker. It’s a  two-level  hierarchical
                     policer  which  first  does  a color-blind marking of the
                     traffic at the queue level,  followed  by  a  color-aware
                     marking  at  the port level. At the end traffic marked as
                     Green or Yellow is forwarded, Red is dropped. For details
                     on how traffic is marked, see RFC 4115. If the  ``default
                     queue’’,  0, is not configured it’s automatically created
                     with the same <b>other_config</b> values as the physical port.

       <b>queues</b>: map of integer-<b>Queue</b> pairs, key in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              A map from queue numbers to <b>Queue</b> records. The  supported  range
              of  queue numbers depend on <b>type</b>. The queue numbers are the same
              as the <b>queue_id</b> used in OpenFlow  in  <b>struct</b>  <b>ofp_action_enqueue</b>
              and other structures.

              Queue  0 is the ``default queue.’’ It is used by OpenFlow output
              actions when no specific queue has been set. When no  configura‐
              tion  for  queue 0 is present, it is automatically configured as
              if a <b>Queue</b> record with empty <b>dscp</b> and <b>other_config</b>  columns  had
              been  specified.  (Before  version 1.6, Open vSwitch would leave
              queue 0 unconfigured in this  case.  With  some  queuing  disci‐
              plines,  this  dropped  all  packets  destined  for  the default
              queue.)

     <u>Configuration</u> <u>for</u> <u>linux-htb</u> <u>and</u> <u>linux-hfsc:</u>

       The <b>linux-htb</b> and <b>linux-hfsc</b> classes support  the  following  key-value
       pair:

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>max-rate</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Maximum  rate  shared by all queued traffic, in bit/s. Optional.
              If not specified, for physical interfaces, the  default  is  the
              link  rate.  For  other interfaces or if the link rate cannot be
              determined, the default is currently 10 Gbps.

     <u>Configuration</u> <u>for</u> <u>egress-policer</u> <u>QoS:</u>

       <b>QoS</b> <b>type</b> <b>egress-policer</b> provides egress  policing  for  userspace  port
       types with DPDK. It has the following key-value pairs defined.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cir</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The  Committed Information Rate (CIR) is measured in bytes of IP
              packets per second, i.e. it includes the IP header, but not link
              specific (e.g. Ethernet) headers. This represents the bytes  per
              second  rate  at which the token bucket will be updated. The cir
              value is calculated by (pps x packet data size). For example as‐
              suming a user wishes to limit a stream  consisting  of  64  byte
              packets  to 1 million packets per second the CIR would be set to
              to to 46000000. This value can be broken into ’1,000,000 x  46’.
              Where  1,000,000  is the policing rate for the number of packets
              per second and 46 represents the size of the packet data  for  a
              64  bytes  IP  packet  without 14 bytes Ethernet and 4 bytes FCS
              header.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>cbs</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Committed Burst Size (CBS) is measured in bytes  and  repre‐
              sents  a  token bucket. At a minimum this value should be be set
              to the expected largest size packet in the  traffic  stream.  In
              practice  larger  values may be used to increase the size of the
              token bucket. If a packet can be transmitted then the  cbs  will
              be  decremented  by the number of bytes/tokens of the packet. If
              there are not enough tokens in the cbs bucket the packet will be
              dropped.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>eir</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Excess Information Rate (EIR) is measured  in  bytes  of  IP
              packets per second, i.e. it includes the IP header, but not link
              specific  (e.g. Ethernet) headers. This represents the bytes per
              second rate at which the token bucket will be updated.  The  eir
              value is calculated by (pps x packet data size). For example as‐
              suming  a  user  wishes  to limit a stream consisting of 64 byte
              packets to 1 million packets per second the EIR would be set  to
              to  to 46000000. This value can be broken into ’1,000,000 x 46’.
              Where 1,000,000 is the policing rate for the number  of  packets
              per  second  and 46 represents the size of the packet data for a
              64 bytes IP packet without 14 bytes Ethernet  and  4  bytes  FCS
              header.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>ebs</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The  Excess Burst Size (EBS) is measured in bytes and represents
              a token bucket. At a minimum this value should be be set to  the
              expected  largest size packet in the traffic stream. In practice
              larger values may be used to increase  the  size  of  the  token
              bucket.  If  a  packet  can  be transmitted then the ebs will be
              decremented by the number of  bytes/tokens  of  the  packet.  If
              there  are  not enough tokens in the cbs bucket the packet might
              be dropped.

     <u>Configuration</u> <u>for</u> <u>linux-sfq:</u>

       The <b>linux-sfq</b> QoS supports the following key-value pairs:

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>perturb</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Number of seconds between consecutive perturbations  in  hashing
              algorithm.  Different  flows  can end up in the same hash bucket
              causing unfairness. Perturbation’s goal is  to  remove  possible
              unfairness.  The  default and recommended value is 10. Too low a
              value is discouraged because each perturbation can cause  packet
              reordering.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>quantum</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              Number  of bytes <b>linux-sfq</b> QoS can dequeue in one turn in round-

<b>Mirror</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       A port mirror within a <b>Bridge</b>.

       A port mirror configures a bridge to send selected  frames  to  special
       ``mirrored’’ ports, in addition to their normal destinations. Mirroring
       traffic  may also be referred to as SPAN or RSPAN, depending on how the
       mirrored traffic is sent.

       When a packet enters an Open vSwitch bridge, it  becomes  eligible  for
       mirroring  based  on  its  ingress port and VLAN. As the packet travels
       through the flow tables, each time it is output to a port,  it  becomes
       eligible  for  mirroring  based  on  the  egress port and VLAN. In Open
       vSwitch 2.5 and later, mirroring occurs just after a packet  first  be‐
       comes  eligible,  using  the packet as it exists at that point; in Open
       vSwitch 2.4 and earlier, mirroring occurs only after a packet has  tra‐
       versed all the flow tables, using the original packet as it entered the
       bridge.  This  makes a difference only when the flow table modifies the
       packet: in Open vSwitch 2.4, the modifications  are  never  visible  to
       mirrors,  whereas  in Open vSwitch 2.5 and later modifications made be‐
       fore the first output that makes it eligible for mirroring to a partic‐
       ular destination are visible.

       A packet that enters an Open vSwitch bridge is mirrored to a particular
       destination only once, even if it is eligible for multiple reasons. For
       example, a packet would be mirrored to a  particular  <b>output_port</b>  only
       once,  even  if  it  is  selected  for  mirroring  to  that port by <b>se‐</b>
       <b>lect_dst_port</b> and <b>select_src_port</b>  in  the  same  or  different  <b>Mirror</b>

     <u>Selecting</u> <u>Packets</u> <u>for</u> <u>Mirroring:</u>

       To be selected for mirroring, a given packet must enter  or  leave  the
       bridge  through  a  selected port and it must also be in one of the se‐
       lected VLANs.

       <b>select_all</b>: boolean
              If true, every packet arriving or departing on any port  is  se‐
              lected for mirroring.

       <b>select_dst_port</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Port</b>s
              Ports on which departing packets are selected for mirroring.

       <b>select_src_port</b>: set of weak reference to <b>Port</b>s
              Ports on which arriving packets are selected for mirroring.

       <b>select_vlan</b>: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095
              VLANs  on which packets are selected for mirroring. An empty set
              selects packets on all VLANs.

       <b>filter</b>: optional string
              When set, only packets that match <b>filter</b> are selected  for  mir‐
              roring.  Packets  that  do not match are ignored by thie mirror.
              The <b>filter</b> syntax is described in  <b>ovs-fields</b>(7).  However,  the
              <b>in_port</b>  field  is not supported; <b>select_src_port</b> should be used
              to limit the mirror to a source port.

              This filter is applied after  <b>select_all</b>,  <b>select_dst_port</b>,  <b>se‐</b>
              <b>lect_src_port</b>, and <b>select_vlan</b>.

     <u>Mirroring</u> <u>Destination</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       These  columns are mutually exclusive. Exactly one of them must be non‐
       empty.

       <b>output_port</b>: optional weak reference to <b>Port</b>
              Output port for selected packets, if nonempty.

              Specifying a port for mirror output reserves  that  port  exclu‐
              sively  for  mirroring.  No frames other than those selected for
              mirroring via this column will be forwarded to the port, and any
              frames received on the port will be discarded.

              The output port may be  any  kind  of  port  supported  by  Open
              vSwitch.  It  may  be,  for  example, a physical port (sometimes
              called SPAN) or a GRE tunnel.

       <b>output_vlan</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              Output VLAN for selected packets, if nonempty.

              The frames will be sent out all ports that trunk <b>output_vlan</b>, as
              well as any ports with implicit VLAN <b>output_vlan</b>.  When  a  mir‐
              rored  frame is sent out a trunk port, the frame’s VLAN tag will
              be set to <b>output_vlan</b>, replacing any existing tag;  when  it  is
              sent  out  an  implicit VLAN port, the frame will not be tagged.
              This type of mirroring is sometimes called RSPAN.

              See the documentation for <b>other_config:forward-bpdu</b> in  the  <b>In‐</b>
              <b>terface</b> table for a list of destination MAC addresses which will
              not  be  mirrored to a VLAN to avoid confusing switches that in‐
              terpret the protocols that they represent.

              <b>Please</b> <b>note:</b> Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that con‐
              tains unmanaged switches. Consider an unmanaged physical  switch
              with  two  ports:  port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2,
              connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received pack‐
              ets into VLAN 123 on port 2. Suppose that the end host  sends  a
              packet  on  port  1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2.
              The Open vSwitch forwards this packet  to  its  destination  and
              then  reflects  it  back  on  port 2 in VLAN 123. This reflected
              packet causes the unmanaged physical switch to replace  the  MAC
              learning  table  entry,  which correctly pointed to port 1, with
              one that incorrectly points to port 2. Afterward,  the  physical
              switch will direct packets destined for the end host to the Open
              vSwitch  on  port  2, instead of to the end host on port 1, dis‐
              rupting connectivity. If mirroring to a VLAN is desired in  this
              scenario,  then the physical switch must be replaced by one that
              learns Ethernet addresses on  a  per-VLAN  basis.  In  addition,
              learning  should  be  disabled  on  the VLAN containing mirrored
              traffic. If this is not done  then  intermediate  switches  will
              learn  the  MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traf‐
              fic. If packets being sent to that end host are  also  mirrored,
              then  they will be dropped since the switch will attempt to send
              them out the input port. Disabling learning for  the  VLAN  will
              cause the switch to correctly send the packet out all ports con‐
              figured  for  that VLAN. If Open vSwitch is being used as an in‐
              termediate switch, learning can be disabled by adding  the  mir‐
              rored VLAN to <b>flood_vlans</b> in the appropriate <b>Bridge</b> table or ta‐
              bles.

              Mirroring  to a GRE tunnel has fewer caveats than mirroring to a
              VLAN and should generally be preferred.

       <b>snaplen</b>: optional integer, in range 14 to 65,535
              Maximum per-packet number of bytes to mirror.

              A mirrored packet with size larger than <b>snaplen</b>  will  be  trun‐
              cated  in datapath to <b>snaplen</b> bytes before sending to the mirror
              output port. If omitted, packets are not truncated.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <u>Core</u> <u>Features:</u>

       <b>type</b>: optional string, either <b>primary</b> or <b>service</b>
              Open vSwitch supports  two  kinds  of  OpenFlow  controllers.  A
              bridge may have any number of each kind:

              Primary controllers
                     This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow
                     specifications.  Usually, a primary controller implements
                     a network policy by taking charge of  the  switch’s  flow
                     table.

                     The  <b>fail_mode</b> column in the <b>Bridge</b> table applies to pri‐
                     mary controllers.

                     When multiple primary controllers  are  configured,  Open
                     vSwitch  connects to all of them simultaneously. OpenFlow
                     provides few facilities to allow multiple controllers  to
                     coordinate  in  interacting with a single switch, so more
                     than one primary controller should be specified  only  if
                     the  controllers  are  themselves  designed to coordinate
                     with each other.

              Service controllers
                     These kinds of OpenFlow controller  connections  are  in‐
                     tended  for  occasional support and maintenance use, e.g.
                     with <b>ovs-ofctl</b>. Usually  a  service  controller  connects
                     only  briefly  to  inspect  or  modify some of a switch’s
                     state.

                     The <b>fail_mode</b> column in the <b>Bridge</b> table does  not  apply
                     to service controllers.

              By  default, Open vSwitch treats controllers with active connec‐
              tion methods as primary controllers and those with passive  con‐
              nection  methods  as service controllers. Set this column to the
              desired type to override this default.

       <b>target</b>: string
              Connection method for controller.

              The following active connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The specified SSL/TLS <u>port</u> on the host at the given <u>host</u>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary)  or  an  IP  address.  The  <b>ssl</b>  column   in   the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table must point to a valid SSL/TLS configu‐
                     ration when this form is used.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The  specified  TCP  <u>port</u>  on the host at the given <u>host</u>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary) or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).  If  <u>host</u>  is  an
                     IPv6   address,   wrap   it   in  square  brackets,  e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              The following passive  connection  methods  are  currently  sup‐
              ported:

              <b>pssl:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens  for  SSL/TLS  connections  on  the specified TCP
                     <u>port</u>. If <u>host</u>, which can either be a DNS name  (if  built
                     with  unbound  library)  or  an IP address, is specified,
                     then connections are restricted to the resolved or speci‐
                     fied local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6). If  <u>host</u>  is
                     an  IPv6  address,  wrap  it  in  square  brackets,  e.g.
                     <b>pssl:6653:[::1]</b>.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653. If <u>host</u> is
                     not specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6)
                     addresses. The <b>ssl</b> column in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table  must
                     point  to a valid SSL/TLS configuration when this form is
                     used.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it currently to 6653.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens for connections on the  specified  TCP  <u>port</u>.  If
                     <u>host</u>,  which  can either be a DNS name (if built with un‐
                     bound library) or an IP address, is specified, then  con‐
                     nections  are restricted to the resolved or specified lo‐
                     cal IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6). If <u>host</u> is an  IPv6
                     address,    wrap    it    in    square   brackets,   e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>. If <u>host</u> is not specified then it listens
                     only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              When multiple controllers are configured for  a  single  bridge,
              the  <b>target</b> values must be unique. Duplicate <b>target</b> values yield
              unspecified results.

       <b>connection_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>in-band</b> or <b>out-of-band</b>
              If it is specified, this setting must be one  of  the  following
              strings  that  describes how Open vSwitch contacts this OpenFlow
              controller over the network:

              <b>in-band</b>
                     In this mode, this controller’s OpenFlow traffic  travels
                     over the bridge associated with the controller. With this
                     setting, Open vSwitch allows traffic to and from the con‐
                     troller  regardless  of the contents of the OpenFlow flow
                     table. (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never  be  able  to
                     connect to the controller, because it did not have a flow
                     to  enable  it.)  This is the most common connection mode
                     because it is not necessary to maintain  two  independent
                     networks.

              <b>out-of-band</b>
                     In  this  mode,  OpenFlow  traffic uses a control network
                     separate from the bridge associated with this controller,
                     that is, the bridge does not use any of its  own  network
                     devices  to  communicate with the controller. The control
                     network must be configured separately,  before  or  after
                     <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is started.

              If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.

     <u>Controller</u> <u>Failure</u> <u>Detection</u> <u>and</u> <u>Handling:</u>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum  number  of  milliseconds to wait between connection at‐
              tempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle  time  on  connection  to
              controller  before  sending an inactivity probe message. If Open
              vSwitch does not communicate with the controller for the  speci‐
              fied  number  of seconds, it will send a probe. If a response is
              not received for  the  same  additional  amount  of  time,  Open
              vSwitch  assumes  the connection has been broken and attempts to
              reconnect. Default is implementation-specific. A value of 0 dis‐
              ables inactivity probes.

     <u>Asynchronous</u> <u>Messages:</u>

       OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers  spontanenously,
       that is, not in response to any request from the controller. These mes‐
       sages  are  called ``asynchronous messages.’’ These columns allow asyn‐
       chronous messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best  use  of
       network resources.

       <b>enable_async_messages</b>: optional boolean
              The  OpenFlow  protocol enables asynchronous messages at time of
              connection establishment, which means that a controller can  re‐
              ceive  asynchronous  messages, potentially many of them, even if
              it turns them off immediately after connecting. Set this  column
              to <b>false</b> to change Open vSwitch behavior to disable, by default,
              all   asynchronous   messages.   The   controller  can  use  the
              <b>NXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG</b> Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn on any
              messages that it does want to receive, if any.

     <u>Controller</u> <u>Rate</u> <u>Limiting:</u>

       A switch can forward packets to a controller over the  OpenFlow  proto‐
       col.  Forwarding  packets  this  way at too high a rate can overwhelm a
       controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow  connection  for  other  pur‐
       poses,  increase  the  latency  of  flow setup, and use an unreasonable
       amount of bandwidth. Therefore, Open vSwitch supports limiting the rate
       of packet forwarding to a controller.

       There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to  be  sent  to  a
       controller:  either  the  packet ``misses’’ in the flow table, that is,
       there is no matching flow, or a flow table  action  says  to  send  the
       packet  to the controller. Open vSwitch limits the rate of each kind of
       packet separately at the configured rate. Therefore,  the  actual  rate
       that  packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the config‐
       ured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons.

       This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow connec‐
       tion. It is not general-purpose QoS. See the <b>QoS</b> table for  quality  of
       service configuration, and <b>ingress_policing_rate</b> in the <b>Interface</b> table
       for ingress policing configuration.

       <b>controller_queue_size</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 512
              This  sets the maximum size of the queue of packets that need to
              be sent to this OpenFlow controller. The value must be less than
              512. If not specified the queue size is limited to the value set
              for the management controller in  <b>other_config:controller-queue-</b>
              <b>size</b>  if present or 100 packets by default. Note: increasing the
              queue size might have a negative impact on latency.

       <b>controller_rate_limit</b>: optional integer, at least 100
              The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the
              OpenFlow controller, in packets per second. If no value is spec‐
              ified, rate limiting is disabled.

       <b>controller_burst_limit</b>: optional integer, at least 25
              When a high rate triggers  rate-limiting,  Open  vSwitch  queues
              packets  to  the  controller for each port and transmits them to
              the controller at the configured rate.  This  value  limits  the
              number  of  queued  packets.  Ports on a bridge share the packet
              queue fairly.

              This value has no effect unless <b>controller_rate_limit</b> is config‐
              ured. The current default when this value is  not  specified  is
              one-quarter  of  <b>controller_rate_limit</b>, meaning that queuing can
              delay forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms.

     <u>Controller</u> <u>Rate</u> <u>Limiting</u> <u>Statistics:</u>

       These values report the effects of rate limiting. Their values are rel‐
       ative to establishment of the most recent OpenFlow connection, or since
       rate limiting was enabled, whichever happened more recently. Each  con‐
       sists  of  two values, one with <b>TYPE</b> replaced by <b>miss</b> for rate limiting
       flow table misses, and the other with <b>TYPE</b> replaced by <b>action</b> for  rate
       limiting packets sent by OpenFlow actions.

       These statistics are reported only when controller rate limiting is en‐
       abled.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>packet-in-TYPE-bypassed</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number of packets sent directly to the controller, without queu‐
              ing, because the rate did not exceed the configured maximum.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>packet-in-TYPE-queued</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              Number of packets added to the queue to send later.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>packet-in-TYPE-dropped</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number of packets added to the queue that were later dropped due
              to  overflow. This value is less than or equal to <b>status:packet-</b>
              <b>in-TYPE-queued</b>.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>packet-in-TYPE-backlog</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number of packets currently queued.  The  other  statistics  in‐
              crease  monotonically, but this one fluctuates between 0 and the
              <b>controller_burst_limit</b> as conditions change.

     <u>Additional</u> <u>In-Band</u> <u>Configuration:</u>

       These values are considered only in in-band control mode  (see  <b>connec‐</b>
       <b>tion_mode</b>).

       When  multiple  controllers  are  configured  on a single bridge, there
       should be only one set of unique values in these columns. If  different
       values  are  set for these columns in different controllers, the effect
       is unspecified.

       <b>local_ip</b>: optional string
              The  IP  address  to  configure  on   the   local   port,   e.g.
              <b>192.168.0.123</b>.  If  this  value is unset, then <b>local_netmask</b> and
              <b>local_gateway</b> are ignored.

       <b>local_netmask</b>: optional string
              The  IP  netmask  to  configure  on   the   local   port,   e.g.
              <b>255.255.255.0</b>.  If <b>local_ip</b> is set but this value is unset, then
              the default is chosen based on whether the IP address  is  class
              A, B, or C.

       <b>local_gateway</b>: optional string
              The IP address of the gateway to configure on the local port, as
              a string, e.g. <b>192.168.0.1</b>. Leave this column unset if this net‐
              work has no gateway.

     <u>Controller</u> <u>Status:</u>

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true</b> if currently connected to this controller, <b>false</b> otherwise.

       <b>role</b>: optional string, one of <b>master</b>, <b>other</b>, or <b>slave</b>
              The  level  of  authority  this controller has on the associated
              bridge. Possible values are:

              <b>other</b>  Allows the controller access to all OpenFlow features.

              <b>master</b> Equivalent to <b>other</b>, except that there may be at most one
                     such controller at a time. If a given controller promotes
                     itself to this role, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  demotes  any  existing
                     controller with the role to <b>slave</b>.

              <b>slave</b>  Allows  the  controller read-only access to OpenFlow fea‐
                     tures. Attempts to modify the flow table will be rejected
                     with  an  error.  Such   controllers   do   not   receive
                     OFPT_PACKET_IN or OFPT_FLOW_REMOVED messages, but they do
                     receive OFPT_PORT_STATUS messages.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to  the  controller;  i.e.  <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key will exist
              only if an error has occurred.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>, <b>CONNECTING</b>,
       <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the controller:

              <b>VOID</b>   Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE</b> Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE</b>   Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These values may change in the future. They  are  provided  only
              for human consumption.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              The  amount of time since this controller last successfully con‐
              nected to the switch (in seconds). Value is empty if  controller
              has never successfully connected.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 1
              The  amount of time since this controller last disconnected from
              the switch (in seconds). Value is empty if controller has  never
              disconnected.

     <u>Connection</u> <u>Parameters:</u>

       Additional  configuration  for  a connection between the controller and
       the Open vSwitch.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dscp</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified  using
              6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP header. DSCP
              provides a mechanism to classify the network traffic and provide
              Quality  of  Service (QoS) on IP networks. The DSCP value speci‐
              fied here is used when establishing the connection  between  the
              controller and the Open vSwitch. If no value is specified, a de‐
              fault  value  of  48 is chosen. Valid DSCP values must be in the
              range 0 to 63.

     <u>Common</u> <u>Columns:</u>

       The overall purpose of these columns is described under <b>Common</b>  <b>Columns</b>
       at the beginning of this document.

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs

       <b>other_config</b>: map of string-string pairs
<b>Manager</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       Configuration  for  a  database  connection to an Open vSwitch database
       (OVSDB) client.

       This   table   primarily   configures   the   Open   vSwitch   database
       (<b>ovsdb-server</b>),  not the Open vSwitch switch (<b>ovs-vswitchd</b>). The switch
       does read the table to determine what connections should be treated  as
       in-band.

       The  Open vSwitch database server can initiate and maintain active con‐
       nections to remote clients. It can also  listen  for  database  connec‐
       tions.

   <b>Details:</b>
     <u>Core</u> <u>Features:</u>

       <b>target</b>: string (must be unique within table)
              Connection method for managers.

              The following connection methods are currently supported:

              <b>ssl:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The specified SSL/TLS <u>port</u> on the host at the given <u>host</u>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary)  or  an  IP  address.  The  <b>ssl</b>  column   in   the
                     <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table must point to a valid SSL/TLS configu‐
                     ration when this form is used.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>tcp:</b><u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
                     The  specified  TCP  <u>port</u>  on the host at the given <u>host</u>,
                     which can either be a DNS name (if built with unbound li‐
                     brary) or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).  If  <u>host</u>  is  an
                     IPv6   address,   wrap   it   in  square  brackets,  e.g.
                     <b>tcp:[::1]:6640</b>.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              <b>pssl:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens for SSL/TLS  connections  on  the  specified  TCP
                     <u>port</u>. Specify 0 for <u>port</u> to have the kernel automatically
                     choose  an available port. If <u>host</u>, which can either be a
                     DNS name (if built with unbound library)  or  an  IP  ad‐
                     dress,  is  specified, then connections are restricted to
                     the resolved or specified local IP address  (either  IPv4
                     or  IPv6  address).  If  <u>host</u> is an IPv6 address, wrap in
                     square brackets, e.g. <b>pssl:6640:[::1]</b>.  If  <u>host</u>  is  not
                     specified then it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) ad‐
                     dresses.  The  <b>ssl</b>  column in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table must
                     point to a valid SSL/TLS configuration when this form  is
                     used.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

                     SSL/TLS support is an optional feature that is not always
                     built as part of Open vSwitch.

              <b>ptcp:</b>[<u>port</u>][<b>:</b><u>host</u>]
                     Listens  for connections on the specified TCP <u>port</u>. Spec‐
                     ify 0 for <u>port</u> to have the kernel automatically choose an
                     available port. If <u>host</u>, which can either be a  DNS  name
                     (if  built  with  unbound  library)  or an IP address, is
                     specified, then connections are  restricted  to  the  re‐
                     solved or specified local IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6
                     address).  If  <u>host</u> is an IPv6 address, wrap it in square
                     brackets, e.g. <b>ptcp:6640:[::1]</b>. If <u>host</u> is not  specified
                     then it listens only on IPv4 addresses.

                     If <u>port</u> is not specified, it defaults to 6640.

              When multiple managers are configured, the <b>target</b> values must be
              unique. Duplicate <b>target</b> values yield unspecified results.

       <b>connection_mode</b>: optional string, either <b>in-band</b> or <b>out-of-band</b>
              If  it  is  specified, this setting must be one of the following
              strings that describes how  Open  vSwitch  contacts  this  OVSDB
              client over the network:

              <b>in-band</b>
                     In  this  mode,  this connection’s traffic travels over a
                     bridge managed by Open vSwitch. With this  setting,  Open
                     vSwitch  allows traffic to and from the client regardless
                     of the contents of the OpenFlow flow  table.  (Otherwise,
                     Open  vSwitch  would  never  be  able  to  connect to the
                     client, because it did not have a  flow  to  enable  it.)
                     This is the most common connection mode because it is not
                     necessary to maintain two independent networks.

              <b>out-of-band</b>
                     In this mode, the client’s traffic uses a control network
                     separate from that managed by Open vSwitch, that is, Open
                     vSwitch  does  not  use any of its own network devices to
                     communicate with the client. The control network must  be
                     configured  separately,  before  or after <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is
                     started.

              If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.

     <u>Client</u> <u>Failure</u> <u>Detection</u> <u>and</u> <u>Handling:</u>

       <b>max_backoff</b>: optional integer, at least 1,000
              Maximum number of milliseconds to wait  between  connection  at‐
              tempts. Default is implementation-specific.

       <b>inactivity_probe</b>: optional integer
              Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the
              client  before  sending  an  inactivity  probe  message. If Open
              vSwitch does not communicate with the client for  the  specified
              number  of  seconds,  it will send a probe. If a response is not
              received for the same additional amount of  time,  Open  vSwitch
              assumes  the  connection  has been broken and attempts to recon‐
              nect. Default is implementation-specific. A value of 0  disables
              inactivity probes.

     <u>Status:</u>

       Key-value pair of <b>is_connected</b> is always updated. Other key-value pairs
       in the status columns may be updated depends on the <b>target</b> type.

       When <b>target</b> specifies a connection method that listens for inbound con‐
       nections  (e.g.  <b>ptcp:</b>  or <b>punix:</b>), both <b>n_connections</b> and <b>is_connected</b>
       may also be updated while the remaining key-value pairs are omitted.

       On the other hand, when <b>target</b> specifies an  outbound  connection,  all
       key-value  pairs  may  be  updated, except the above-mentioned two key-
       value pairs associated with inbound connection targets. They are  omit‐
       ted.

       <b>is_connected</b>: boolean
              <b>true</b> if currently connected to this manager, <b>false</b> otherwise.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>last_error</b>: optional string
              A human-readable description of the last error on the connection
              to  the  manager; i.e. <b>strerror(errno)</b>. This key will exist only
              if an error has occurred.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>state</b>: optional string, one of <b>ACTIVE</b>, <b>BACKOFF</b>, <b>CONNECTING</b>,
       <b>IDLE</b>, or <b>VOID</b>
              The state of the connection to the manager:

              <b>VOID</b>   Connection is disabled.

              <b>BACKOFF</b>
                     Attempting to reconnect at an increasing period.

              <b>CONNECTING</b>
                     Attempting to connect.

              <b>ACTIVE</b> Connected, remote host responsive.

              <b>IDLE</b>   Connection is idle. Waiting for response to keep-alive.

              These values may change in the future. They  are  provided  only
              for human consumption.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>sec_since_connect</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              The  amount  of  time  since this manager last successfully con‐
              nected to the database (in seconds). Value is empty  if  manager
              has never successfully connected.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>sec_since_disconnect</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              The amount of time since this manager last disconnected from the
              database  (in seconds). Value is empty if manager has never dis‐
              connected.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>locks_held</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  holds.  Omitted  if  the  connection  does not hold any
              locks.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>locks_waiting</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  is currently waiting to acquire. Omitted if the connec‐
              tion is not waiting for any locks.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>locks_lost</b>: optional string
              Space-separated list of the names of OVSDB locks that  the  con‐
              nection  has  had  stolen by another OVSDB client. Omitted if no
              locks have been stolen from this connection.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>n_connections</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 2
              When <b>target</b> specifies a connection method that listens  for  in‐
              bound  connections  (e.g. <b>ptcp:</b> or <b>pssl:</b>) and more than one con‐
              nection is actually active, the value is the  number  of  active
              connections. Otherwise, this key-value pair is omitted.

       <b>status</b> <b>:</b> <b>bound_port</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              When <b>target</b> is <b>ptcp:</b> or <b>pssl:</b>, this is the TCP port on which the
              OVSDB  server  is  listening.  (This is particularly useful when
              <b>target</b> specifies a port of 0, allowing the kernel to choose  any
              available port.)

     <u>Connection</u> <u>Parameters:</u>

       Additional  configuration  for a connection between the manager and the
       Open vSwitch Database.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>dscp</b>: optional string, containing an integer
              The Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) is specified  using
              6 bits in the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP header. DSCP
              provides a mechanism to classify the network traffic and provide
              Quality  of  Service (QoS) on IP networks. The DSCP value speci‐
              fied here is used when establishing the connection  between  the
              manager  and  the  Open vSwitch. If no value is specified, a de‐
              fault value of 48 is chosen. Valid DSCP values must  be  in  the
              range 0 to 63.

<b>NetFlow</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       A NetFlow target. NetFlow is a protocol that exports a  number  of  de‐
       tails  about  terminating IP flows, such as the principals involved and
       duration.

   <b>Summary:</b>

         <b>external_ids</b>                map of string-string pairs

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>targets</b>: set of 1 or more strings
              NetFlow targets in the form <u>ip</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>. The <u>ip</u>  must  be  specified
              numerically, not as a DNS name.

       <b>engine_id</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 255
              Engine ID to use in NetFlow messages. Defaults to datapath index
              if not specified.

       <b>engine_type</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 255
              Engine type to use in NetFlow messages. Defaults to datapath in‐
              dex if not specified.

       <b>active_timeout</b>: integer, at least -1
              The  interval  at  which NetFlow records are sent for flows that
              are still active, in seconds. A value of <b>0</b> requests the  default
              timeout  (currently  600 seconds); a value of <b>-1</b> disables active
              timeouts.

              The NetFlow passive timeout, for flows that become inactive,  is
              not  configurable.  It  will  vary depending on the Open vSwitch
              version, the forms and contents of the OpenFlow flow tables, CPU
              and memory usage, and network activity. A typical passive  time‐
              out is about a second.

       <b>add_id_to_interface</b>: boolean
              If  this  column’s value is <b>false</b>, the ingress and egress inter‐
              face fields of NetFlow flow records are  derived  from  OpenFlow
              port  numbers.  When  it is <b>true</b>, the 7 most significant bits of
              these fields will be replaced by the least significant 7 bits of
              the engine id. This is useful because many NetFlow collectors do
              not expect multiple switches to be  sending  messages  from  the
              same  host,  so  they  do not store the engine information which
              could be used to disambiguate the traffic.

              When this option is enabled, a maximum of  508  ports  are  sup‐
              ported.

<b>Datapath</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       Configuration for a datapath within <b>Open_vSwitch</b>.

       A datapath is responsible for providing the  packet  handling  in  Open
       vSwitch.  There  are  two primary datapath implementations used by Open
       vSwitch: kernel and  userspace.  Kernel  datapath  implementations  are
       available  for  Linux  and Hyper-V, and selected as <b>system</b> in the <b>data‐</b>
       <b>path_type</b> column of the <b>Bridge</b> table. The userspace datapath is used by
       DPDK and AF-XDP, and is selected as <b>netdev</b> in the <b>datapath_type</b>  column
       of the <b>Bridge</b> table.

       A  datapath  of a particular type is shared by all the bridges that use
       that datapath. Thus, configurations applied to this  table  affect  all
       bridges that use this datapath.

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>datapath_version</b>: string
              Reports the version number of the Open vSwitch datapath in  use.
              This  allows management software to detect and report discrepan‐
              cies between Open vSwitch userspace and datapath versions.  (The
              <b>ovs_version</b>  column in the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> reports the Open vSwitch
              userspace version.) The version reported depends on the datapath
              in use:

              •      When the kernel  module  included  in  the  Open  vSwitch
                     source tree is used, this column reports the Open vSwitch
                     version from which the module was taken.

              •      When the kernel module that is part of the upstream Linux
                     kernel is used, this column reports <b>&lt;unknown&gt;</b>.

              •      When  the datapath is built into the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> binary,
                     this column reports <b>&lt;built-in&gt;</b>. A built-in datapath is by
                     definition the same version  as  the  rest  of  the  Open
                     vSwitch userspace.

              •      Other  datapaths  (such  as  the Hyper-V kernel datapath)
                     currently report <b>&lt;unknown&gt;</b>.

              A version discrepancy between <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> and the  datapath  in
              use  is  not  normally  cause for alarm. The Open vSwitch kernel
              datapaths for Linux and Hyper-V, in particular, are designed for
              maximum inter-version compatibility: any userspace version works
              with with any kernel version. Some reasons do exist to insist on
              particular user/kernel pairings. First,  newer  kernel  versions
              add new features, that can only be used by new-enough userspace,
              e.g. VXLAN tunneling requires certain minimal userspace and ker‐
              nel  versions. Second, as an extension to the first reason, some
              newer kernel versions add new features for enhancing performance
              that only new-enough userspace versions can take advantage of.

       <b>ct_zones</b>: map of integer-<b>CT_Zone</b> pairs, key in range 0 to 65,535
              Configuration for connection tracking zones. Each pair maps from
              a zone id to a configuration for that zone. Zone  <b>0</b>  applies  to
              the default zone (ie, the one used if a zone is not specified in
              connection tracking-related OpenFlow matches and actions).

     <u>Capabilities:</u>

       The  <b>capabilities</b>  column reports a datapath’s features. For the <b>netdev</b>
       datapath, the capabilities are  fixed  for  a  given  version  of  Open
       vSwitch  because  this  datapath is built into the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> binary.
       The Linux kernel and Windows and other datapaths, which are external to
       OVS userspace, can vary in version and capabilities independently  from
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

       Some  of these features indicate whether higher-level Open vSwitch fea‐
       tures are available. For example,  OpenFlow  features  for  connection-
       tracking  are available only when <b>capabilities:ct_state</b> is <b>true</b>. A con‐
       troller that wishes to determine whether a feature is supported  could,
       therefore, consult the relevant capabilities in this table. However, as
       a general rule, it is better for a controller to try to use the higher-
       level feature and use the result as an indication of support, since the
       low-level  capabilities  are  more  likely  to shift over time than the
       high-level features that rely on them.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>max_vlan_headers</b>: optional string, containing an inte‐
       ger, at least 0
              Number of 802.1q VLAN headers  supported  by  the  datapath,  as
              probed  by  the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> slow path. If the datapath supports
              more VLAN headers than the slow  path,  this  reports  the  slow
              path’s  limit.  The  value  of  <b>other-config:vlan-limit</b>  in  the
              <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table does not influence the number reported here.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>recirc</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If this is  true,  then  the  datapath  supports  recirculation,
              specifically   OVS_KEY_ATTR_RECIRC_ID.   Recirculation   enables
              higher performance for MPLS  and  active-active  load  balancing
              bonding modes.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>lb_output_action</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If  this  is true, then the datapath supports optimized balance-
              tcp bond mode. This capability replaces existing <b>hash</b> and <b>recirc</b>
              actions with new action <b>lb_output</b> and  avoids  recirculation  of
              packet  in  datapath.  It is supported only for balance-tcp bond
              mode in netdev datapath. The new action gives higher performance
              by using bond buckets instead of post  recirculation  flows  for
              selection  of  member port from bond. By default this new action
              is disabled, however it can be  enabled  by  setting  <b>other-con‐</b>
              <b>fig:lb-output-action</b> in <b>Port</b> table.

     <u>Connection-Tracking</u> <u>Capabilities:</u>

       These  capabilities are granular because Open vSwitch and its datapaths
       added support for connection tracking over several releases, with  fea‐
       tures added individually over that time.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_state</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If  true,  datapath  supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_STATE, which indi‐
              cates support for the bits in the OpenFlow <b>ct_state</b>  field  (see
              <b>ovs-fields</b>(7))  other  than <b>snat</b> and <b>dnat</b>, which have a separate
              capability.

              If this is false, the  datapath  does  not  support  connection-
              tracking  at all and the remaining connection-tracking capabili‐
              ties should all be false. In this case, Open vSwitch will reject
              flows that match on the <b>ct_state</b> field or use the <b>ct</b> action.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_state_nat</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If true, it means that the datapath supports the <b>snat</b>  and  <b>dnat</b>
              flags  in  the  OpenFlow <b>ct_state</b> field. The <b>ct_state</b> capability
              must be true for this to make sense.

              If false, Open vSwitch will reject flows that match on the  <b>snat</b>
              or <b>dnat</b> bits in <b>ct_state</b> or use <b>nat</b> in the <b>ct</b> action.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_zone</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If  true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_ZONE. If false, Open
              vSwitch rejects flows that match on the <b>ct_zone</b>  field  or  that
              specify a nonzero zone or a zone field on the <b>ct</b> action.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_mark</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If  true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_MARK. If false, Open
              vSwitch rejects flows that match on the <b>ct_mark</b>  field  or  that
              set <b>ct_mark</b> in the <b>ct</b> action.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_label</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If true, datapath supports OVS_KEY_ATTR_CT_LABEL. If false, Open
              vSwitch  rejects  flows that match on the <b>ct_label</b> field or that
              set <b>ct_label</b> in the <b>ct</b> action.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_orig_tuple</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If true, the datapath supports matching  the  5-tuple  from  the
              connection’s original direction for IPv4 traffic. If false, Open
              vSwitch rejects flows that match on <b>ct_nw_src</b> or <b>ct_nw_dst</b>, that
              use  the <b>ct</b> feature of the <b>resubmit</b> action, or the <b>force</b> keyword
              in the <b>ct</b> action. (The latter isn’t tied to connection  tracking
              support  of  original tuples in any technical way. They are con‐
              flated because all current datapaths implemented  the  two  fea‐
              tures at the same time.)

              If  this  and  <b>capabilities:ct_orig_tuple6</b>  are both false, Open
              vSwitch rejects flows that match on <b>ct_nw_proto</b>,  <b>ct_tp_src</b>,  or
              <b>ct_tp_dst</b>.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_orig_tuple6</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              If  true,  the  datapath  supports matching the 5-tuple from the
              connection’s original direction for IPv6 traffic. If false, Open
              vSwitch rejects flows that match on <b>ct_ipv6_src</b> or <b>ct_ipv6_dst</b>.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>masked_set_action</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports masked data in OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SET
              actions.  Masked  data  can  improve  performance  by   allowing
              megaflows to match on fewer fields.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>tnl_push_pop</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True  if the datapath supports tnl_push and pop actions. This is
              a prerequisite for a datapath to support native tunneling.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ufid</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_FLOW_ATTR_UFID.  UFID  support
              improves  revalidation performance by transferring less data be‐
              tween the slow path and the datapath.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>trunc</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_TRUNC  action.  If
              false,  the  <b>output</b> action with packet truncation requires every
              packet to be sent to the Open vSwitch slow path, which is likely
              to make it too slow for mirroring traffic in bulk.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>nd_ext</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if  the  datapath  supports  OVS_KEY_ATTR_ND_EXTENSIONS  to
              match  on  ICMPv6  "ND  reserved"  and  "ND  option type" header
              fields. If false, the datapath reports error if the  feature  is
              used.

     <u>Clone</u> <u>Actions:</u>

       When  Open  vSwitch  translates actions from OpenFlow into the datapath
       representation, some of the datapath actions may modify the  packet  or
       have  other  side  effects  that later datapath actions can’t undo. The
       OpenFlow  <b>ct</b>,  <b>meter</b>,  <b>output</b>  with  truncation,  <b>encap</b>,   <b>decap</b>,   and
       <b>dec_nsh_ttl</b> actions fall into this category. Often, this is not a prob‐
       lem because nothing later on needs the original packet.

       Such actions can, however, occur in circumstances where the translation
       does  require  the original packet. For example, an OpenFlow <b>output</b> ac‐
       tion might direct a packet to a patch port, which might in turn lead to
       a <b>ct</b> action that NATs the packet (which cannot be undone), and then af‐
       terward when control flow pops back across the patch  port  some  other
       action might need to act on the original packet.

       Open  vSwitch  has  two different ways to implement this ``save and re‐
       store’’ via datapath actions. These  capabilities  indicate  which  one
       Open  vSwitch will choose. When neither is available, Open vSwitch sim‐
       ply fails in situations that require this feature.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>clone</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE action. This
              is the preferred option for saving and restoring packets,  since
              it is intended for the purpose, but old datapaths do not support
              it. Open vSwitch will use it whenever it is available.

              (The  OpenFlow  <b>clone</b>  action  does  not  always yield a OVS_AC‐
              TION_ATTR_CLONE action. It only does so when the  datapath  sup‐
              ports it and the <b>clone</b> brackets actions that otherwise cannot be
              undone.)

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>sample_nesting</b>: optional string, containing an integer,
       at least 0
              Maximum  level  of nesting allowed by OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SAMPLE ac‐
              tion. Open vSwitch misuses this action for saving and  restoring
              packets when the datapath supports more than 3 levels of nesting
              and OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CLONE is not available.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_eventmask</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True  if the datapath’s OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT action implements the
              OVS_CT_ATTR_EVENTMASK attribute. When this is true, Open vSwitch
              uses the event mask feature to limit the  kinds  of  events  re‐
              ported  to conntrack update listeners. When Open vSwitch doesn’t
              limit the event mask, listeners receive reports of numerous usu‐
              ally unimportant events, such  as  TCP  state  machine  changes,
              which can waste CPU time.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_clear</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True  if  the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CT_CLEAR action.
              If false, the OpenFlow <b>ct_clear</b> action  has  no  effect  on  the
              datapath.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>max_hash_alg</b>: optional string, containing an integer, at
       least 0
              Highest supported dp_hash algorithm. This allows Open vSwitch to
              avoid  requesting  a packet hash that the datapath does not sup‐
              port.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>check_pkt_len</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_CHECK_PKT_LEN.  If
              false,  Open  vSwitch  implements the <b>check_pkt_larger</b> action by
              sending every packet through the Open vSwitch slow  path,  which
              is likely to make it too slow for handling traffic in bulk.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_timeout</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_CT_ATTR_TIMEOUT in the OVS_AC‐
              TION_ATTR_CT  action.  If  false,  Open vswitch cannot implement
              timeout policies based on connection tracking zones, as  config‐
              ured through the <b>CT_Timeout_Policy</b> table.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>explicit_drop_action</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              True  if  the  datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_DROP. If false,
              explicit drop action will not be sent to the datapath.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_zero_snat</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports all-zero SNAT. This is  a  special
              case  if  the  <b>src</b>  IP  address  is configured as all 0’s, i.e.,
              <b>nat(src=0.0.0.0)</b>. In this case, when a source port collision  is
              detected  during  the commit, the source port will be translated
              to an ephemeral port. If there is no collision, no SNAT is  per‐
              formed.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>ct_flush</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports CT flush OpenFlow Nicira extension
              called <b>NXT_CT_FLUSH</b>. The <b>NXT_CT_FLUSH</b> extensions allows to flush
              CT entries based on specified parameters.

       <b>capabilities</b> <b>:</b> <b>psample</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
              True if the datapath supports OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PSAMPLE. If false,
              local sampling will not be supported with the Linux kernel data‐
              path.

       <b>ct_zone_default_limit</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              Default  connection  tracking  zone limit that is applied to all
              zones that didn’t specify the <b>limit</b> explicitly. If the limit  is
              unspecified  the default limit configuration for the datapath is
              left intact. The value 0 means unlimited.

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>agent</b>: optional string
              Determines  the  agent address, that is, the IP address reported
              to collectors as the source of the sFlow data. It may be  an  IP
              address or the name of a network device. In the latter case, the
              network device’s IP address is used,

              If  not  specified,  the  agent device is figured from the first
              target address and the routing table. If the routing table  does
              not  contain  a  route to the target, the IP address defaults to
              the <b>local_ip</b> in the collector’s <b>Controller</b>.

              If an agent IP address cannot be determined, sFlow is disabled.

       <b>header</b>: optional integer
              Number of bytes of a sampled packet to send to the collector. If
              not specified, the default is 128 bytes.

       <b>polling</b>: optional integer
              Polling rate in seconds to send port statistics to  the  collec‐
              tor. If not specified, defaults to 30 seconds.

       <b>sampling</b>: optional integer
              Rate  at which packets should be sampled and sent to the collec‐
              tor. If not specified, defaults to 400, which means one  out  of
              400 packets, on average, will be sent to the collector.

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
<b>IPFIX</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       Configuration for sending packets to IPFIX collectors.

       IPFIX is a protocol that exports a number of details about  flows.  The
       IPFIX  implementation in Open vSwitch samples packets at a configurable
       rate, extracts flow information from those packets,  optionally  caches
       and  aggregates  the  flow  information, and sends the result to one or
       more collectors.

       IPFIX in Open vSwitch can be configured two different ways:

              •      With <b>per-bridge</b> <b>sampling</b>,  Open  vSwitch  performs  IPFIX
                     sampling automatically on all packets that pass through a
                     bridge. To configure per-bridge sampling, create an <b>IPFIX</b>
                     record and point a <b>Bridge</b> table’s <b>ipfix</b> column to it. The
                     <b>Flow_Sample_Collector_Set</b>  table  is  not  used  for per-
                     bridge sampling.

              •      With <b>flow-based</b> <b>sampling</b>, <b>sample</b> actions in the  OpenFlow
                     flow table drive IPFIX sampling. See <b>ovs-actions</b>(7) for a
                     description of the <b>sample</b> action.

                     Flow-based sampling also requires database configuration:
                     create a <b>IPFIX</b> record that describes the IPFIX configura‐
                     tion  and  a <b>Flow_Sample_Collector_Set</b> record that points
                     to the <b>Bridge</b> whose flow table holds the  <b>sample</b>  actions
                     and to <b>IPFIX</b> record. The <b>ipfix</b> in the <b>Bridge</b> table is not
                     used for flow-based sampling.

       tion of the differences between per-bridge and flow-based sampling.

       <b>sampling</b>: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,294,967,295
              The  rate  at  which  packets should be sampled and sent to each
              target collector. If not specified, defaults to 400, which means
              one out of 400 packets, on average, will be sent to each  target
              collector.

       <b>obs_domain_id</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              The  IPFIX  Observation  Domain ID sent in each IPFIX packet. If
              not specified, defaults to 0.

       <b>obs_point_id</b>: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295
              The IPFIX Observation Point ID sent in each IPFIX  flow  record.
              If not specified, defaults to 0.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>enable-input-sampling</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              By  default,  Open  vSwitch  samples and reports flows at bridge
              port input in IPFIX flow records. Set this column  to  <b>false</b>  to
              disable input sampling.

       <b>other_config</b> <b>:</b> <b>enable-output-sampling</b>: optional string, either <b>true</b> or
       <b>false</b>
              By  default,  Open  vSwitch  samples and reports flows at bridge
              port output in IPFIX flow records. Set this column to  <b>false</b>  to
              disable output sampling.

       The  overall purpose of these columns is described under <b>Common</b> <b>Columns</b>
       at the beginning of this document.

       <b>external_ids</b>: map of string-string pairs
<b>Flow_Sample_Collector_Set</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       A set of IPFIX or local sampling collectors of packet samples generated
       by OpenFlow <b>sample</b> actions.

       If the column <b>ipfix</b> contains a reference to a valid IPFIX  entry,  sam‐
       ples  will  be emitted via IPFIX. This mechanism is known as flow-based
       IPFIX sampling, as opposed to bridge-based sampling (see the <b>IPFIX</b>  ta‐
       ble for a description of the two forms).

       If  the column <b>local_group_id</b> contains an integer and the running data‐
       path supports local sample emission, packets will be sent to some local
       sample collector. Samples will contain the group  number  specified  by
       <b>local_group_id</b>  which  helps  identify their source as well as a 64-bit
       cookie result from the concatenation of  the  observation_domain_id  an
       the  observation_point_id  in network byte order. The way the sample is
       emitted and made available for local collectors  is  datapath-specific.
       Currently  only  Linux kernel datapath supports local sampling which is
       implemented by sending the packet  to  the  <b>psample</b>  netlink  multicast
       group.

       Note: both <b>local_group_id</b> and <b>ipfix</b> can be configured simultaneously.

<b>AutoAttach</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       Auto Attach configuration within a bridge. The  IETF  Auto-Attach  SPBM
       draft  standard  describes  a compact method of using IEEE 802.1AB Link
       Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE  802.1aq  Shortest
       Path  Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices to
       individual services in a SPB network. The intent here is to allow  net‐
       work  applications  and devices using OVS to be able to easily take ad‐
       vantage of features offered by industry standard SPB networks.

       Auto Attach (AA) uses LLDP to communicate between a directly  connected
       Auto  Attach Client (AAC) and Auto Attach Server (AAS). The LLDP proto‐
       col is extended to add two new  Type-Length-Value  tuples  (TLVs).  The
       first  new  TLV supports the ongoing discovery of directly connected AA
       correspondents. Auto Attach operates by regularly transmitting AA  dis‐
       covery  TLVs  between  the AA client and AA server. By exchanging these
       discovery messages, both the AAC and AAS learn the system name and sys‐
       tem description of their peer. In the OVS context, OVS operates as  the
       AA  client and the AA server resides on a switch at the edge of the SPB
       network.

       Once AA discovery has been completed the AAC then uses the  second  new
       TLV  to  deliver identifier mappings from the AAC to the AAS. A primary
       feature of Auto Attach is to facilitate the mapping  of  VLANs  defined
       outside the SPB network onto service ids (ISIDs) defined within the SPM
       network.  By doing so individual external VLANs can be mapped onto spe‐
       cific SPB network services. These VLAN id to ISID mappings can be  con‐
       figured  and  managed  locally using new options added to the ovs-vsctl
       command.

       The Auto Attach OVS feature does not provide a full  implementation  of
       the  LLDP  protocol.  Support  for the mandatory TLVs as defined by the
       LLDP standard and support for the AA TLV extensions is  provided.  LLDP
       protocol  support  in  OVS can be enabled or disabled on a port by port
       basis. LLDP support is disabled by default.
