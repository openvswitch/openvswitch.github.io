<u>ovs-vswitchd</u>(8)               Open vSwitch Manual              <u>ovs-vswitchd</u>(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-vswitchd - Open vSwitch daemon

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> [<u>database</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       A  daemon that manages and controls any number of Open vSwitch switches
       on the local machine.

       The  <u>database</u>  argument  specifies   how   <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>   connects   to
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>.   <u>database</u>  may  be an OVSDB active or passive connection
       method,  as  described  in  <b>ovsdb</b>(7).   The  default  is  <b>unix:/usr/lo‐</b>
       <b>cal/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  retrieves its configuration from <u>database</u> at startup.  It
       sets up Open vSwitch datapaths and then operates switching across  each
       bridge  described in its configuration files.  As the database changes,
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> automatically updates its configuration to match.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> switches may be configured with any of the following  fea‐
       tures:

       •      L2 switching with MAC learning.

       •      NIC  bonding  with  automatic  fail-over and source MAC-based TX
              load balancing ("SLB").

       •      802.1Q VLAN support.

       •      Port mirroring, with optional VLAN tagging.

       •      NetFlow v5 flow logging.

       •      sFlow(R) monitoring.

       •      Connectivity to an external OpenFlow controller, such as NOX.

       Only a single instance of <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is intended to run at a time.  A
       single <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> can manage any number of switch  instances,  up  to
       the maximum number of supported Open vSwitch datapaths.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  does  all  the necessary management of Open vSwitch data‐
       paths itself.  Thus, <b>ovs-dpctl</b>(8) (and its userspace datapath  counter‐
       parts  accessible  via  <b>ovs-appctl</b>  <b>dpctl/</b><u>command</u>)  are not needed with
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> and should not be used because they can interfere with its
       operation.  These tools are still useful for diagnostics.

       An Open vSwitch datapath kernel module must be loaded for  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       to  be  useful.   Refer to the documentation for instructions on how to
       build and load the Open vSwitch kernel module.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--mlockall</b>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to call the <b>mlockall()</b> function, to  attempt
              to  lock  all  of  its  process memory into physical RAM on page
              faults (on allocation, when  running  on  Linux  kernel  4.4  or
              older),  preventing  the kernel from paging any of its memory to
              disk.  This helps to avoid networking interruptions due to  sys‐
              tem memory pressure.

              Some systems do not support <b>mlockall()</b> at all, and other systems
              only  allow  privileged users, such as the superuser, to use it.
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> emits a log message if <b>mlockall()</b> is unavailable or
              unsuccessful.

   <b>DPDK</b> <b>Options</b>
       For details on initializing <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to use DPDK  ports,  refer  to
       the documentation or <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5).

   <b>DPDK</b> <b>HW</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--hw-rawio-access</b>
              Tells  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  to  retain the <b>CAP_SYS_RAWIO</b> capability, to
              allow userspace drivers access to  raw  hardware  memory.   This
              will  also allow the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> daemon to call <b>iopl()</b> and <b>iop‐</b>
              <b>erm()</b> functions as well as access memory devices to set port ac‐
              cess.  This is a <b>very</b> powerful capability, so generally only en‐
              able as needed for specific hardware (for example mlx5 with full
              hardware offload via rte_flow).

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes a file (by default, <b>ovs-vswitchd.pid</b>) to be created indi‐
              cating the PID of the running process.  If the <u>pidfile</u>  argument
              is  not  specified,  or  if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is
              created in <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the  specified  pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> refuses to start.  Specify  <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>  to
              cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  as a background process.  The process forks,
              and in the child it starts a new session,  closes  the  standard
              file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging
              to  the  console), and changes its current directory to the root
              (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).  After the child completes its
              initialization, the parent exits.   <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  detaches  only
              after  it  has  connected to the database, retrieved the initial
              configuration, and set up that configuration.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor the  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  dae‐
              mon.   If  the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a pro‐
              gramming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>, <b>SIGALRM</b>, <b>SIGBUS</b>, <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,  <b>SIG‐</b>
              <b>PIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>,  <b>SIGXCPU</b>,  or  <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process
              starts a new copy of it.  If the daemon dies or  exits  for  an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This  option  is  normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also func‐
              tions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By default, when <b>--detach</b> is specified, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> changes its
              current working directory to the root  directory  after  it  de‐
              taches.  Otherwise, invoking <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> from a carelessly cho‐
              sen  directory  would  prevent the administrator from unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying  <b>--no-chdir</b>  suppresses  this  behavior,   preventing
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  from changing its current working directory.  This
              may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common  be‐
              havior  to  write  core dumps into the current working directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to  work  with
              files  under well-known directories determined during build.  It
              is better to stick with this default behavior  and  not  to  use
              this  flag  unless  some other Access Control is used to confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g.  DAC
              or  MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
              itself and hence should not be considered as a full  confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user</b> Causes  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  to  run  as  a different user specified in
              "user:group", thus dropping most of the root  privileges.  Short
              forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with current user or
              group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started by the root
              user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before dropping root  privileges.  Daemons
              that  interact  with  a  datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be
              granted three  additional  capabilities,  namely  CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST  and  CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability change will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons, specifying this option will cause  the  daemon  process
              not to start.

   <b>Service</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are valid only on Windows platform.

       <b>--service</b>
              Causes  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  to run as a service in the background. The
              service should already have been created through external  tools
              like <b>SC.exe</b>.

       <b>--service-monitor</b>
              Causes the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> service to be automatically restarted by
              the  Windows  services  manager if the service dies or exits for
              unexpected reasons.

              When <b>--service</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
       <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s identity for outgoing SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on <b>-p</b> or <b>--private-key</b> to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
       <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate   that
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  should  use to verify certificates presented to it
              by SSL/TLS peers.   (This  may  be  the  same  certificate  that
              SSL/TLS  peers  use to verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or
              <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one,  depending  on  the
              PKI design in use.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
       <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
              Disables  verification  of  certificates  presented  by  SSL/TLS
              peers.  This introduces a security risk, because it  means  that
              certificates  cannot  be  verified  to be those of known trusted
              hosts.

       <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
              When <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--ca-cert</b>.  If it does not exist, then <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> will attempt
              to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL/TLS peer on its  first
              SSL/TLS  connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is
              successful, it will immediately drop the connection  and  recon‐
              nect, and from then on all SSL/TLS connections must be authenti‐
              cated  by  a  certificate  signed by the CA certificate thus ob‐
              tained.

              <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b>  <b>man-in-the-mid‐</b>
              <b>dle</b>  <b>attack</b>  <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificate</b>, but it may be
              useful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA cer‐
              tificate as part of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.  SSL/TLS pro‐
              tocols do not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

       <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><u>peer-cacert.pem</u>
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL/TLS peers.  <u>peer-cacert.pem</u> should be
              the CA certificate used to sign <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own  certificate,
              that  is,  the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>.  If
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s certificate is  self-signed,  then  <b>--certificate</b>
              and <b>--peer-ca-cert</b> should specify the same file.

              This  option  is  not  useful  in  normal operation, because the
              SSL/TLS peer must already have the CA certificate for  the  peer
              to  have  any  confidence  in <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s identity.  However,
              this offers a way for a new installation  to  bootstrap  the  CA
              certificate on its first SSL/TLS connection.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.  (If <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
                     closes  its  standard file descriptors, so logging to the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b> is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--ver‐</b>
              <b>bose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
              Sets  the  RFC5424  facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be
              one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,
              <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,  <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>,
              <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is  not
              specified,  <b>daemon</b>  is  used as the default for the local system
              syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the  target
              provided via the <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name   used  if  <u>file</u>  is  omitted  is  <b>/usr/local/var/log/open‐</b>
              <b>vswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
              Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The <u>host</u> must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
              Specify <u>method</u> how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      <b>libc</b>, use libc <b>syslog()</b> function.  Downside of using this
                     options is that libc adds fixed prefix to  every  message
                     before  it  is  actually  sent  to the syslog daemon over
                     <b>/dev/log</b> UNIX domain socket.

              •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and older versions use  hard  coded
                     parser  function  anyway  that  limits UNIX domain socket
                     use.  If you want to use arbitrary  message  format  with
                     older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u>:<u>port</u>, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible  to  use  arbitrary  message format also with older
                     <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When sending syslog messages over  UDP  socket
                     extra  precaution needs to be taken into account, for ex‐
                     ample, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen  on
                     the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could
                     be interfering with local syslog traffic  and  there  are
                     some  security  considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      <b>null</b>, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The default is  taken  from  the  <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b>  environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is <b>libc</b>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--unixctl=</b><u>socket</u>
              Sets  the  name of the control socket on which <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> lis‐
              tens for runtime management  commands  (see  <b>RUNTIME</b>  <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
              <b>COMMANDS</b>, below).  If <u>socket</u> does not begin with <b>/</b>, it is inter‐
              preted   as   relative  to  <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch</b>.   If
              <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, the  default  socket  is  <b>/usr/lo‐</b>
              <b>cal/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.</b><u>pid</u><b>.ctl</b>,   where   <u>pid</u>   is
              <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement commands.  A file is created in  the  absolute  path  as
              pointed  by <u>socket</u> or if <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, a file is
              created as <b>ovs-vswitchd.ctl</b> in the configured <u>OVS</u><b>_</b><u>RUNDIR</u>  direc‐
              tory.   The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix do‐
              main socket.

              Specifying <b>none</b> for <u>socket</u> disables the control socket feature.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) can send commands to a running <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> process.  The
       currently supported commands are described below.  The command descrip‐
       tions assume an understanding of how to configure Open vSwitch.

   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>exit</b> <u>--cleanup</u>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to gracefully  terminate.  If  <u>--cleanup</u>  is
              specified, deletes flows from datapaths and releases other data‐
              path  resources configured by <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.  Otherwise, datapath
              flows and other resources remains undeleted.  Resources of data‐
              paths that are integrated into <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  (e.g.   the  <b>netdev</b>
              datapath  type)  are always released regardless of <u>--cleanup</u> ex‐
              cept for ports with <b>internal</b> type. Use <u>--cleanup</u> to release  <b>in‐</b>
              <b>ternal</b> ports too.

       <b>qos/show-types</b> <u>interface</u>
              Queries  the  interface  for  a list of Quality of Service types
              that are configurable via Open vSwitch for the given <u>interface</u>.

       <b>qos/show</b> <u>interface</u>
              Queries the kernel for Quality of Service configuration and sta‐
              tistics associated with the given <u>interface</u>.

       <b>bfd/show</b> [<u>interface</u>]
              Displays detailed information about Bidirectional Forwarding De‐
              tection configured on <u>interface</u>.  If <u>interface</u> is not specified,
              then displays detailed information about all interfaces with BFD
              enabled.

       <b>bfd/set-forwarding</b> [<u>interface</u>] <u>status</u>
              Force the fault status of the BFD module on  <u>interface</u>  (or  all
              interfaces  if  none  is  given)  to  be  <u>status</u>.  <u>status</u> can be
              "true", "false", or "normal" which reverts to the  standard  be‐
              havior.

       <b>cfm/show</b> [<u>interface</u>]
              Displays  detailed  information about Connectivity Fault Manage‐
              ment configured on <u>interface</u>.  If <u>interface</u>  is  not  specified,
              then displays detailed information about all interfaces with CFM
              enabled.

       <b>cfm/set-fault</b> [<u>interface</u>] <u>status</u>
              Force  the  fault  status of the CFM module on <u>interface</u> (or all
              interfaces if none is  given)  to  be  <u>status</u>.   <u>status</u>  can  be
              "true",  "false",  or "normal" which reverts to the standard be‐
              havior.

       <b>stp/tcn</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Forces a topology change event on <u>bridge</u> if  it's  running  STP.
              This  may  cause it to send Topology Change Notifications to its
              peers and flush its MAC table.  If no <u>bridge</u> is given, forces  a
              topology change event on all bridges.

       <b>stp/show</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Displays detailed information about spanning tree on the <u>bridge</u>.
              If  <u>bridge</u>  is not specified, then displays detailed information
              about all bridges with STP enabled.

       <b>rstp/tcn</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Forces a topology change event on <u>bridge</u> if it's  running  RSTP.
              This  may  cause it to send Topology Change Notifications to its
              peers and flush its MAC table.  If no <u>bridge</u> is given, forces  a
              topology change event on all bridges.

       <b>rstp/show</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Displays  detailed  information about rapid spanning tree on the
              <u>bridge</u>.  If <u>bridge</u> is not specified, then displays detailed  in‐
              formation about all bridges with RSTP enabled.

   <b>BRIDGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage bridges.

       <b>fdb/add</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>port</u> <u>vlan</u> <u>mac</u>
              Adds  <u>mac</u>  address  to a <u>port</u> and <u>vlan</u> on a <u>bridge</u>. This utility
              can be used to pre-populate fdb table without relying on dynamic
              mac learning.

       <b>fdb/del</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>vlan</u> <u>mac</u>
              Deletes <u>mac</u> address from a <u>port</u> and <u>vlan</u> on a <u>bridge</u>.

       <b>fdb/flush</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Flushes <u>bridge</u> MAC address learning table, or all  learning  ta‐
              bles if no <u>bridge</u> is given.

       <b>fdb/show</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists  each  MAC  address/VLAN  pair  learned  by  the specified
              <u>bridge</u>, along with the port on which it was learned and the  age
              of the entry, in seconds.

       <b>fdb/stats-clear</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Clear  <u>bridge</u> MAC address learning table statistics, or all sta‐
              tistics if no <u>bridge</u> is given.

       <b>fdb/stats-show</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Show MAC address learning table  statistics  for  the  specified
              <u>bridge</u>.

       <b>mdb/flush</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Flushes  <u>bridge</u> multicast snooping table, or all snooping tables
              if no <u>bridge</u> is given.

       <b>mdb/show</b> <u>bridge</u>
              Lists each multicast group/VLAN pair learned  by  the  specified
              <u>bridge</u>,  along with the port on which it was learned and the age
              of the entry, in seconds.

       <b>bridge/reconnect</b> [<u>bridge</u>]
              Makes <u>bridge</u> drop all of its OpenFlow controller connections and
              reconnect.  If <u>bridge</u> is not specified, then  all  bridges  drop
              their controller connections and reconnect.

              This  command  might be useful for debugging OpenFlow controller
              issues.

       <b>bridge/dump-flows</b> [<b>--offload-stats</b>] <u>bridge</u>
              Lists all flows in <u>bridge</u>, including those  normally  hidden  to
              commands  such  as <b>ovs-ofctl</b> <b>dump-flows</b>.  Flows set up by mecha‐
              nisms such as in-band control and fail-open are hidden from  the
              controller  since  it is not allowed to modify or override them.
              If <b>--offload-stats</b> are specified then also list  statistics  for
              offloaded  packets  and  bytes,  which are a subset of the total
              packets and bytes.

   <b>BOND</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage bonded ports on an Open  vSwitch's  bridges.   To
       understand  some of these commands, it is important to understand a de‐
       tail of the bonding implementation  called  ``source  load  balancing''
       (SLB).  Instead of directly assigning Ethernet source addresses to mem‐
       bers,  the  bonding  implementation  computes  a  function that maps an
       48-bit Ethernet source addresses into an 8-bit value  (a  ``MAC  hash''
       value).  All of the Ethernet addresses that map to a single 8-bit value
       are then assigned to a single member.

       <b>bond/list</b>
              Lists all of the bonds, and their members, on each bridge.

       <b>bond/show</b> [<u>port</u>]
              Lists  all of the bond-specific information (updelay, downdelay,
              time until the next rebalance) about the given bonded  <u>port</u>,  or
              all  bonded  ports  if no <u>port</u> is given.  Also lists information
              about each members: whether it is enabled or disabled, the  time
              to  completion of an updelay or downdelay if one is in progress,
              whether it is the active member, the hashes assigned to the mem‐
              ber.  Any LACP information related to this bond may be found us‐
              ing the <b>lacp/show</b> command.

       <b>bond/migrate</b> <u>port</u> <u>hash</u> <u>member</u>
              Only valid for SLB bonds.  Assigns a given MAC  hash  to  a  new
              member.   <u>port</u>  specifies the bond port, <u>hash</u> the MAC hash to be
              migrated (as a decimal number between 0 and 255), and <u>member</u> the
              new member to be assigned.

              The reassignment is not permanent: rebalancing or fail-over will
              cause the MAC hash to be shifted to a new member  in  the  usual
              manner.

              A MAC hash cannot be migrated to a disabled member.

       <b>bond/set-active-member</b> <u>port</u> <u>member</u>
              Sets <u>member</u> as the active member on <u>port</u>.  <u>member</u> must currently
              be enabled.

              The  setting  is  not permanent: a new active member will be se‐
              lected if <u>member</u> becomes disabled.

       <b>bond/enable-member</b> <u>port</u> <u>member</u>
       <b>bond/disable-member</b> <u>port</u> <u>member</u>
              Enables (or disables) <u>member</u> on the given  bond  <u>port</u>,  skipping
              any updelay (or downdelay).

              This  setting  is not permanent: it persists only until the car‐
              rier status of <u>member</u> changes.

       <b>bond/hash</b> <u>mac</u> [<u>vlan</u>] [<u>basis</u>]
              Returns the hash value which would be used for <u>mac</u> with <u>vlan</u> and
              <u>basis</u> if specified.

       <b>lacp/show</b> [<u>port</u>]
              Lists all of the LACP related information about the given  <u>port</u>:
              active or passive, aggregation key, system id, and system prior‐
              ity.   Also  lists  information about each member: whether it is
              enabled or disabled, whether it is attached or detached, port id
              and priority, actor information, and  partner  information.   If
              <u>port</u>  is not specified, then displays detailed information about
              all interfaces with CFM enabled.

       <b>lacp/stats-show</b> [<u>port</u>]
              Lists various stats about LACP PDUs (number of RX/TX  PDUs,  bad
              PDUs  received)  and member state (number of times its state ex‐
              pired/defaulted and carrier status changed) for the given  <u>port</u>.
              If  <u>port</u> is not specified, then displays stats of all interfaces
              with LACP enabled.

   <b>DPCTL</b> <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The primary way to configure <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is through the  Open  vSwitch
       database,  e.g. using <b>ovs-vsctl</b>(8).  These commands provide a debugging
       interface for managing datapaths.  They  implement  the  same  features
       (and syntax) as <b>ovs-dpctl</b>(8).  Unlike <b>ovs-dpctl</b>(8), these commands work
       with  datapaths  that are integrated into <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> (e.g. the <b>netdev</b>
       datapath type).

       Do  not  use  commands  to  add  or  remove  or  modify  datapaths   if
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is running because this interferes with <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s own
       datapath management.

       <b>dpctl/add-dp</b> <u>dp</u> [<u>netdev</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...]
              Creates datapath <u>dp</u>, with a local port also named <u>dp</u>.  This will
              fail if a network device <u>dp</u> already exists.

              If  <u>netdev</u>s  are  specified,  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  adds them to the new
              datapath, just as if <b>add-if</b> was specified.

       <b>dpctl/del-dp</b> <u>dp</u>
              Deletes datapath <u>dp</u>.  If <u>dp</u> is associated with any  network  de‐
              vices, they are automatically removed.

       <b>dpctl/add-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>netdev</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...
              Adds each <u>netdev</u> to the set of network devices datapath <u>dp</u> moni‐
              tors,  where  <u>dp</u> is the name of an existing datapath, and <u>netdev</u>
              is the name of one of the host's  network  devices,  e.g.  <b>eth0</b>.
              Once a network device has been added to a datapath, the datapath
              has  complete  ownership of the network device's traffic and the
              network device appears silent to the rest of the system.

              A <u>netdev</u> may be followed by a comma-separated list  of  options.
              The following options are currently supported:

              <b>type=</b><u>type</u>
                     Specifies  the  type of port to add.  The default type is
                     <b>system</b>.

              <b>port_no=</b><u>port</u>
                     Requests a specific port number within the datapath.   If
                     this  option  is not specified then one will be automati‐
                     cally assigned.

              <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
                     Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's configu‐
                     ration.

              <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) documents the available port  types  and
              options.

       <b>dpctl/set-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>port</u>[<b>,</b><u>option</u>]...
              Reconfigures  each  <u>port</u>  in  <u>dp</u> as specified.  An <u>option</u> of the
              form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> adds the specified key-value option to  the  port
              or  overrides  an  existing  key's value.  An <u>option</u> of the form
              <u>key</u><b>=</b>, that is, without a value, deletes the key-value named <u>key</u>.
              The type and port number of a port cannot be  changed,  so  <b>type</b>
              and <b>port_no</b> are only allowed if they match the existing configu‐
              ration.

       <b>dpctl/del-if</b> <u>dp</u> <u>netdev</u>...
              Removes each <u>netdev</u> from the list of network devices datapath <u>dp</u>
              monitors.

       <b>dpctl/dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.

       <b>dpctl/show</b> <b>[-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] [<u>dp</u>...]
              Prints  a summary of configured datapaths, including their data‐
              path numbers and a list of ports  connected  to  each  datapath.
              (The local port is identified as port 0.)  If <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b>
              is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for
              each port.

              The  datapath  numbers consists of flow stats and mega flow mask
              stats.

              The "lookups" row displays three stats related  to  flow  lookup
              triggered  by processing incoming packets in the datapath. "hit"
              displays number of packets matches existing flows. "missed" dis‐
              plays the number of packets not matching any existing  flow  and
              require  user space processing.  "lost" displays number of pack‐
              ets destined for user space process but subsequently dropped be‐
              fore reaching userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss"  equals  to
              the total number of packets datapath processed.

              The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.

              The  "masks"  row displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is
              omitted for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit"  displays
              the total number of masks visited for matching incoming packets.
              "total" displays number of masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" dis‐
              plays  the average number of masks visited per packet; the ratio
              between "hit" and total number of packets processed by the data‐
              path.

              If one or more datapaths  are  specified,  information  on  only
              those datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> displays
              information about all configured datapaths.

   <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>FLOW</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.
       The  flow  table entries (both matches and actions) that they work with
       are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different and consid‐
       erably simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module.   Do
       not  use  commands  to  add  or  remove  or  modify  datapath  flows if
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> is running because it interferes with  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s  own
       datapath  flow  management.   Use  <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8),  instead, to work with
       OpenFlow flow entries.

       The <u>dp</u> argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly  one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       <b>dpctl/dump-flows</b> [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names</b> | <b>--no-names</b>] [<u>dp</u>] [<b>filter=</b><u>fil‐</u>
       <u>ter</u>] [<b>type=</b><u>type</u>] [<b>pmd=</b><u>pmd</u>]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow ta‐
              ble.   Without  <b>-m</b>  or  <b>--more</b>, output omits match fields that a
              flow wildcards entirely; with <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, output includes  all
              wildcarded fields.

              If  <b>filter=</b><u>filter</u>  is  specified,  only  displays the flows that
              match the <u>filter</u>. <u>filter</u> is a flow in the form similar  to  that
              accepted  by  <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s  <b>add-flow</b>  command. (This is not an
              OpenFlow flow: besides  other  differences,  it  never  contains
              wildcards.)   The  <u>filter</u>  is  also  useful  to match wildcarded
              fields   in   the   datapath   flow.   As   an   example,   <b>fil‐</b>
              <b>ter='tcp,tp_src=100'</b>  will  match  the  datapath flow containing
              '<b>tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)</b>'.

              If <b>pmd=</b><u>pmd</u> is specified, only displays flows  of  the  specified
              pmd.  Using <b>pmd=</b><u>-1</u> will restrict the dump to flows from the main
              thread.   This  option  is only supported by the <b>userspace</b> <b>data‐</b>
              <b>path</b>.

              If <b>type=</b><u>type</u> is specified, only displays flows of the  specified
              types.     This    option    supported   only   for   <b>ovs-appctl</b>
              <b>dpctl/dump-flows</b>.  <u>type</u> is a comma  separated  list,  which  can
              contain any of the following:
                 <b>ovs</b> - displays flows handled in the ovs dp
                 <b>tc</b> - displays flows handled in the tc dp
                 <b>dpdk</b> - displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
                 <b>offloaded</b> - displays flows offloaded to the HW
                 <b>non-offloaded</b> - displays flows not offloaded to the HW
                 <b>partially-offloaded</b> - displays flows where only part of their
              proccessing is done in HW
                 <b>all</b> - displays all the types of flows

              By  default all the types of flows are displayed.  <b>ovs-dpctl</b> al‐
              ways acts as if the <b>type</b> was <u>ovs</u>.

       <b>dpctl/add-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u> <u>actions</u>

       <b>dpctl/mod-flow</b> [<b>--clear</b>] [<b>--may-create</b>] [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u>
       <u>actions</u>
              Adds or modifies a flow in <u>dp</u>'s flow table that, when  a  packet
              matching <u>flow</u> arrives, causes <u>actions</u> to be executed.

              The  <b>add-flow</b> command succeeds only if <u>flow</u> does not already ex‐
              ist in <u>dp</u>.  Contrariwise,  <b>mod-flow</b>  without  <b>--may-create</b>  only
              modifies  the  actions for an existing flow.  With <b>--may-create</b>,
              <b>mod-flow</b> will add a new flow or modify an existing one.

              If <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b> is specified,  then  <b>mod-flow</b>  prints  the
              modified  flow's statistics.  A flow's statistics are the number
              of packets and bytes that have  passed  through  the  flow,  the
              elapsed  time  since the flow last processed a packet (if ever),
              and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags processed through
              the flow.

              With <b>--clear</b>, <b>mod-flow</b> zeros out  the  flow's  statistics.   The
              statistics  printed  if <b>-s</b> or <b>--statistics</b> is also specified are
              those from just before clearing the statistics.

              NOTE: <u>flow</u> and  <u>actions</u>  do  not  match  the  syntax  used  with
              <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s <b>add-flow</b> command.

              <b>Usage</b> <b>Examples</b>

              Forward ARP between ports 1 and 2 on datapath myDP:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 1

              Forward all IPv4 traffic between two addresses on ports 1 and 2:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.4,dst=172.31.110.5)" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.5,dst=172.31.110.4)" 1

       <b>dpctl/add-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
       <b>dpctl/mod-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
       <b>dpctl/del-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>file</u>
              Reads  flow  entries from <u>file</u> (or <b>stdin</b> if <u>file</u> is <b>-</b>) and adds,
              modifies, or deletes each entry  to  the  datapath.   Each  flow
              specification (e.g., each line in <u>file</u>) may start with <b>add</b>, <b>mod‐</b>
              <b>ify</b>, or <b>delete</b> keyword to specify whether a flow is to be added,
              modified,  or deleted. A flow specification without one of these
              keywords is treated based on the used command.  All flow modifi‐
              cations are executed as individual  transactions  in  the  order
              specified.

       <b>dpctl/del-flow</b> [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] [<u>dp</u>] <u>flow</u>
              Deletes  the flow from <u>dp</u>'s flow table that matches <u>flow</u>.  If <b>-s</b>
              or <b>--statistics</b> is specified, then <b>del-flow</b> prints  the  deleted
              flow's statistics.

       <b>dpctl/get-flow</b> [<u>dp</u>] ufid:<u>ufid</u> [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>--names</b> | <b>--no-names</b>]
              Fetches  the  flow  from  <u>dp</u>'s flow table with unique identifier
              <u>ufid</u>.  <u>ufid</u> must be specified as  a  string  of  32  hexadecimal
              characters.

       <b>dpctl/del-flows</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow table.

   <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>FLOW</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The  following  commands  are  useful for debugging and configuring the
       datapath flow cache settings.

       <b>dpctl/cache-get-size</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints the current cache sizes to the console.

       <b>dpctl/cache-set-size</b> <u>dp</u> <u>cache</u> <u>size</u>
              Set the <u>dp</u>'s specific <u>cache</u> to the given <u>size</u>.  The  cache  name
              can be found by using the <b>cache-get-size</b> command.

   <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>TRACKING</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The  following  commands  are  useful for debugging and configuring the
       connection tracking table in the datapath.

       The <u>dp</u> argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly  one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       <b>N.B.</b>(Linux  specific): the <u>system</u> datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel mod‐
       ule Open vSwitch datapaths) share a single  connection  tracking  table
       (which is also used by other kernel subsystems, such as iptables, nfta‐
       bles and the regular host stack).  Therefore, the following commands do
       not apply specifically to one datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-enabled</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-disabled</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b>
              Enables  or disables IP fragmentation handling for the userspace
              connection tracker.  Either <b>v4</b> or <b>v6</b> must  be  specified.   Both
              IPv4  and IPv6 fragment reassembly are enabled by default.  Only
              supported for the userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-min-frag</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>v4</b>|<b>v6</b> <u>minfrag</u>
              Sets the minimum fragment size (L3 header and data) for  non-fi‐
              nal  fragments  to  <u>minfrag</u>.  Either <b>v4</b> or <b>v6</b> must be specified.
              For enhanced DOS security, higher  minimum  fragment  sizes  can
              usually be used.  The default IPv4 value is 1200 and the clamped
              minimum  is 400.  The default IPv6 value is 1280, with a clamped
              minimum of 400, for testing flexibility.  The  maximum  fragment
              size  is not clamped, however, setting this value too high might
              result in valid fragments being  dropped.   Only  supported  for
              userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-set-max-nfrags</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>maxfrags</u>
              Sets  the  maximum  number of fragments tracked by the userspace
              datapath connection tracker to <u>maxfrags</u>.  The default  value  is
              1000  and the clamped maximum is 5000.  Note that packet buffers
              can be held by the fragmentation module while fragments are  in‐
              complete, but will timeout after 15 seconds.  Memory pool sizing
              should  be  set accordingly when fragmentation is enabled.  Only
              supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ipf-get-status</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>]
              Gets the configuration settings and fragment counters associated
              with the fragmentation handling of the userspace  datapath  con‐
              nection  tracker.  With <b>-m</b> or <b>--more</b>, also dumps the IP fragment
              lists.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/dump-conntrack</b> [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>] [<b>-s</b> | <b>--statistics</b>] [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Prints to the console all the connection entries in the  tracker
              used  by  <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, only shows the connec‐
              tions in <u>zone</u>.  With <b>--more</b>, some  implementation  specific  de‐
              tails  are  included.  With <b>--statistics</b> timeouts and timestamps
              are added to the output.

       <b>dpctl/dump-conntrack-exp</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>]
              Prints to the console all the expectation entries in the tracker
              used by <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, only shows the  expecta‐
              tions in <u>zone</u>. Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/flush-conntrack</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>] [<u>ct-origin-tuple</u> [<u>ct-reply-tu‐</u>
       <u>ple</u>]]
              Flushes  the  connection entries in the tracker used by <u>dp</u> based
              on <u>zone</u> and connection tracking tuple <u>ct-origin-tuple</u>.   If  <u>ct-</u>
              <u>tuple</u>  is  not provided, flushes all the connection entries.  If
              <b>zone</b>=<u>zone</u> is specified, only flushes the connections in <u>zone</u>.

              If <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u> is provided, flushes the connection en‐
              try specified by <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u> in <u>zone</u>.   The  zone  de‐
              faults  to  0  if  it is not provided.  The userspace connection
              tracker requires flushing with the original pre-NATed tuple  and
              a  warning  log  will  be otherwise generated.  The tuple can be
              partial and will remove all connections that are matching on the
              specified fields.  In order to specify only <u>ct-reply-tuple</u>, pro‐
              vide empty string as <u>ct-origin-tuple</u>.

              Note: Currently there is a limitation for matching on  ICMP,  in
              order  to  partially  match  on ICMP parameters the <u>ct-[orig|re‐</u>
              <u>ply]-tuple</u> has to include either source or destination IP.

              An example of an IPv4 ICMP <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u>:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP <u>ct-[orig|reply]-tuple</u>:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

       <b>dpctl/ct-stats-show</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>] [<b>-m</b> | <b>--more</b>]
              Displays the number of connections grouped by protocol  used  by
              <u>dp</u>.  If <b>zone=</b><u>zone</u> is specified, numbers refer to the connections
              in  <u>zone</u>.  With <b>--more</b>, groups by connection state for each pro‐
              tocol.

       <b>dpctl/ct-bkts</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>gt=</b><u>threshold</u>]
              For each conntrack bucket, displays the  number  of  connections
              used  by  <u>dp</u>.   If <b>gt=</b><u>threshold</u> is specified, bucket numbers are
              displayed when the number of connections in a bucket is  greater
              than <u>threshold</u>.

       <b>dpctl/ct-set-maxconns</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>maxconns</u>
              Sets the maximum limit of connection tracker entries to <u>maxconns</u>
              on  <u>dp</u>.   This  can be used to reduce the processing load on the
              system due to connection tracking or simply limiting  connection
              tracking.   If the number of connections is already over the new
              maximum limit request then the new maximum  limit  will  be  en‐
              forced  when  the number of connections decreases to that limit,
              which normally happens due to connection expiry.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-maxconns</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints the maximum limit of connection tracker  entries  on  <u>dp</u>.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-nconns</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints  the  current number of connection tracker entries on <u>dp</u>.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-enable-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
       <b>dpctl/ct-disable-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Enables or disables TCP sequence checking.   When  set  to  dis‐
              abled,  all  sequence number verification is disabled, including
              for TCP resets.  This is similar, but not the same  as  'be_lib‐
              eral'  mode, as in Netfilter.  Disabling sequence number verifi‐
              cation is not an optimization in itself, but is needed for  some
              hardware  offload support which might offer some performance ad‐
              vantage. Sequence number checking is enabled by default  to  en‐
              force  better  security  and should only be disabled if required
              for hardware offload support.  This command  is  only  supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-tcp-seq-chk</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints  whether  TCP sequence checking is enabled or disabled on
              <u>dp</u>.  Only supported for the userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-set-sweep-interval</b> [<u>dp</u>] <u>ms</u>
              Sets the sweep interval. Only supported for the userspace  data‐
              path.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-sweep-interval</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Prints  the current sweep interval in ms. Only supported for the
              userspace datapath.

       <b>dpctl/ct-set-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>default=</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u>]
       [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>,<b>limit=</b><u>limit</u>]...
              Sets the maximum allowed number of connections in  a  connection
              tracking  zone.  A specific <u>zone</u> may be set to <u>limit</u>, and multi‐
              ple zones may be specified with a comma-separated  list.   If  a
              per-zone  limit  for  a  particular zone is not specified in the
              datapath, it defaults to the default per-zone limit.  A  default
              zone  may  be specified with the <b>default=</b><u>default</u><b>_</b><u>limit</u> argument.
              Initially, the default per-zone limit is unlimited.   An  unlim‐
              ited number of entries may be set with <b>0</b> limit.

       <b>dpctl/ct-del-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] <b>zone=</b><u>zone[,zone]</u>...
              Deletes  the connection tracking limit for <u>zone</u>.  Multiple zones
              may be specified with a comma-separated list.

       <b>dpctl/ct-get-limits</b> [<u>dp</u>] [<b>zone=</b><u>zone</u>[<b>,</b><u>zone</u>]...]
              Retrieves the maximum allowed number of connections and  current
              counts  per-zone.   If <u>zone</u> is given, only the specified zone(s)
              are printed.  If no zones are specified, all the zone limits and
              counts are provided.  The command always  displays  the  default
              zone limit.

   <b>DPDK</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage DPDK components.

       <b>dpdk/lcore-list</b>
              Lists   the   DPDK   lcores   and   their  cpu  affinity.   When
              RTE_MAX_LCORE lcores are registered, some OVS PMD threads  won't
              appear.

       <b>dpdk/log-list</b>
              Lists  all DPDK components that emit logs and their logging lev‐
              els.

       <b>dpdk/log-set</b> [<u>spec</u>]
              Sets DPDK components logging level. Without any <u>spec</u>,  sets  the
              logging  <b>level</b> for all DPDK components to <b>debug</b>. Otherwise, <u>spec</u>
              is a list of words separated by spaces: a word can be  either  a
              logging  <b>level</b>  (<b>emergency</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>critical</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>no‐</b>
              <b>tice</b>, <b>info</b> or <b>debug</b>) or a <b>pattern</b> matching DPDK components  (see
              <b>dpdk/log-list</b>  command  on  <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8))  separated by a colon
              from the logging <b>level</b> to apply.

       <b>dpdk/get-malloc-stats</b>
              Prints the heap information statistics about DPDK malloc.

   <b>DPIF-NETDEV</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands are used to expose internal information (mostly  statis‐
       tics)  about the "dpif-netdev" userspace datapath. If there is only one
       datapath (as is often the case, unless <b>dpctl/</b> commands are  used),  the
       <u>dp</u>  argument  can  be omitted. By default the commands present data for
       all pmd threads in the datapath. By specifying the "-pmd  Core"  option
       one can filter the output for a single pmd in the datapath.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show</b> [<b>-pmd</b> <u>core</u>] [<u>dp</u>]
              Shows  performance  statistics for one or all pmd threads of the
              datapath <u>dp</u>. The special thread "main" sums up the statistics of
              every non pmd thread.

              The sum of "phwol hits", "simple match hits", "emc  hits",  "smc
              hits",  "megaflow  hits"  and  "miss"  is  the  number of packet
              lookups performed by the datapath. Beware  that  a  recirculated
              packet  experiences  one additional lookup per recirculation, so
              there may be more lookups than forwarded packets  in  the  data‐
              path.

              The  MFEX  Opt  hits  displays  the  number  of packets that are
              processed by the optimized miniflow extract implementations.

              Cycles are counted using the TSC  or  similar  facilities  (when
              available on the platform). The duration of one cycle depends on
              the processing platform.

              "idle  cycles" refers to cycles spent in PMD iterations not for‐
              warding any any packets. "processing cycles"  refers  to  cycles
              spent  in PMD iterations forwarding at least one packet, includ‐
              ing the cost for polling, processing and transmitting said pack‐
              ets.

              To reset these counters use <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear</b>.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Resets to zero the per pmd thread performance numbers  shown  by
              the   <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show</b>  and  <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-show</b>
              commands.  It will NOT reset datapath or bridge statistics, only
              the values shown by the above commands.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-show</b> [<b>-nh</b>] [<b>-it</b> <u>iter</u><b>_</b><u>len</u>] [<b>-ms</b> <u>ms</u><b>_</b><u>len</u>] [<b>-pmd</b> <u>core</u>]
       [<u>dp</u>]
              Shows detailed performance metrics for one or all  pmds  threads
              of the user space datapath.

              The collection of detailed statistics can be controlled by a new
              configuration  parameter "other_config:pmd-perf-metrics". By de‐
              fault it is disabled. The run-time overhead, when enabled, is in
              the order of 1%.

              This raw recorded data is used threefold:


              1.     In histograms for each of the following metrics:
                     —      cycles/iteration (logarithmic)

                            are divided linear or logarithmic.
              2.     A cyclic history of the above metrics for 1024 iterations
              3.     A  cyclic  history  of the cummulative/average values per
                     millisecond wall clock for the last 1024 milliseconds:

                     —      upcalls
                     —      avg. cycles/upcall

              The command options are:

              Here "Rx packets" actually reflects the number of  packets  for‐
              warded  by the datapath. "Datapath passes" matches the number of

              command.

              To  reset the counters and start a new measurement use <b>dpif-net‐</b>
              <b>dev/pmd-stats-clear</b>.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-log-set</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>before</u>] [<b>-a</b> <u>after</u>] [<b>-e</b>|<b>-ne</b>]
       [<b>-us</b> <u>usec</u>] [<b>-q</b> <u>qlen</u>]
              The userspace "netdev" datapath is able  to  supervise  the  PMD
              performance  metrics  and detect iterations with suspicious sta‐
              tistics according to the following criteria:

              —      The iteration lasts longer than  <u>usec</u>  microseconds  (de‐
                     fault  250).   This can be used to capture events where a
                     PMD is blocked or interrupted for such a period  of  time
                     that there is a risk for dropped packets on any of its Rx
                     queues.

              —      The  max  vhost  qlen  exceeds  a threshold <u>qlen</u> (default
                     128). This can be used to infer virtio queue overruns and
                     dropped packets inside a VM, which are not visible in OVS
                     otherwise.

              Such suspicious iterations can be logged together with their it‐
              eration statistics in the <b>ovs-vswitchd.log</b> to be able to  corre‐
              late them to packet drop or other events outside OVS.

              The above command enables (<b>on</b>) or disables (<b>off</b>) supervision and
              logging  at run-time and can be used to adjust the above thresh‐
              olds for detecting suspicious iterations. By default supervision
              and logging is disabled.

              The command options are:

              <b>-b</b> <u>before</u>
                     The number of iterations before the suspicious  iteration
                     to be logged (default 5).

              <b>-a</b> <u>after</u>
                     The  number  of iterations after the suspicious iteration
                     to be logged (default 5).

              <b>-e</b>     Extend logging interval if another  suspicious  iteration
                     is detected before logging occurs.

              <b>-ne</b>    Do  not extend logging interval if another suspicious it‐
                     eration is detected before logging occurs (default).

              <b>-q</b> <u>qlen</u>
                     Suspicious vhost queue  fill  level  threshold.  Increase
                     this to 512 if the Qemu supports 1024 virtio queue length
                     (default 128).

              <b>-us</b> <u>usec</u>
                     Change  the duration threshold for a suspicious iteration
                     (default 250 us).

       Note: Logging of suspicious iterations itself consumes  a  considerable
       amount of processing cycles of a PMD which may be visible in the itera‐
       tion  history.   In  the worst case this can lead OVS to detect another
       suspicious iteration caused by logging.

       If more than 100 iterations around a  suspicious  iteration  have  been
       logged  once, OVS falls back to the safe default values (-b 5 -a 5 -ne)
       to avoid that logging itself continuously  causes  logging  of  further
       suspicious iterations.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-show</b> [<b>-pmd</b> <u>core</u>] [<u>dp</u>]
              For  one  or all pmd threads of the datapath <u>dp</u> show the list of
              queue-ids with port names, which this thread polls.

       <b>dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-rebalance</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              Reassigns rxqs to pmds in the datapath <u>dp</u> based on their current
              usage.

       <b>dpif-netdev/bond-show</b> [<u>dp</u>]
              When "other_config:lb-output-action" is set to "true", the user‐
              space datapath handles the load balancing of bonds directly  in‐
              stead  of  depending  on flow recirculation (only in balance-tcp
              mode).

              When this is the case, the above command prints the load-balanc‐
              ing information of the bonds configured in datapath  <u>dp</u>  showing
              the interface associated with each bucket (hash).

       <b>dpif-netdev/subtable-lookup-prio-get</b>
              Lists  the  DPCLS  implementations  or lookup functions that are
              available as well as their priorities.

       <b>dpif-netdev/subtable-lookup-prio-set</b> <u>lookup</u><b>_</b><u>function</u> <u>prio</u>
              Sets the priority of a lookup function by name, <u>lookup</u><b>_</b><u>function</u>,
              and priority, <u>prio</u>, which should be a  positive  integer  value.
              The highest priority lookup function is used for classification.

              The number of affected dpcls ports and subtables is returned.

       <b>dpif-netdev/dpif-impl-get</b>
              Lists the DPIF implementations that are available.

       <b>dpif-netdev/dpif-impl-set</b> <u>dpif</u><b>_</b><u>impl</u>
              Sets  the DPIF to be used to <u>dpif</u><b>_</b><u>impl</u>. By default "dpif_scalar"
              is used.

       <b>dpif-netdev/miniflow-parser-get</b>
              Lists the miniflow extract implementations that are available.

       <b>dpif-netdev/miniflow-parser-set</b> [<b>-pmd</b> <u>core</u>] <u>miniflow</u><b>_</b><u>impl</u> [<u>study</u><b>_</b><u>cnt</u>]
              Sets the miniflow extract to <u>miniflow</u><b>_</b><u>impl</u> for a  specified  PMD
              or all PMDs in the case where no value is specified.  By default
              "scalar"  is  used.  <u>study</u><b>_</b><u>cnt</u> defaults to 128 and indicates the
              number of packets that the "study" miniflow implementation  must
              parse before choosing an optimal implementation.

   <b>DPIF-NETLINK</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These  commands  are  used to expose internal information of the "dpif-
       netlink" kernel space datapath.

       <b>dpif-netlink/dispatch-mode</b>
              Displays the "dispatch-mode" for all datapaths.

   <b>NETDEV-DPDK</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage DPDK related ports (<b>type=</b><u>dpdk*</u>).

       <b>netdev-dpdk/set-admin-state</b> [<u>interface</u>] <b>up</b> | <b>down</b>
              Change the admin state for DPDK <u>interface</u> to <b>up</b> or <b>down</b>.  If <u>in‐</u>
              <u>terface</u> is not specified, then it applies to all DPDK ports.

       <b>netdev-dpdk/detach</b> <u>pci-address</u>
              Detaches device with corresponding <u>pci-address</u> from DPDK.   This
              command can be used to detach device if it wasn't detached auto‐
              matically  after  port  deletion. Refer to the documentation for
              details and instructions.

       <b>netdev-dpdk/get-mempool-info</b> [<u>interface</u>]
              Prints the debug information about memory pool used by DPDK  <u>in‐</u>
              <u>terface</u>.   If  called  without arguments, information of all the
              available mempools will be printed. For additional mempool  sta‐
              tistics  enable  <b>CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MEMPOOL_DEBUG</b>  while building
              DPDK.

   <b>ODP-EXECUTE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage the "odp-execute" component.


       <b>odp-execute/action-impl-show</b>
              Lists the actions implementations that are available  and  high‐
              lights the currently enabled one.

       <b>odp-execute/action-impl-set</b> <u>action</u><b>_</b><u>impl</u>
              Sets  the action implementation to any available implementation.
              By default "scalar" is used.

   <b>DATAPATH</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands query and modify datapaths.  They  are  are  similar  to
       <b>ovs-dpctl</b>(8) commands.  <b>dpif/show</b> has the additional functionality, be‐
       yond  <b>dpctl/show</b> of printing OpenFlow port numbers.  The other commands
       are redundant and will be removed in a future release.

       <b>dpif/dump-dps</b>
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.

       <b>dpif/show</b>
              Prints a summary of configured datapaths,  including  statistics
              and  a  list  of connected ports.  The port information includes
              the OpenFlow port number, datapath port number,  and  the  type.
              (The local port is identified as OpenFlow port 65534.)

       <b>dpif/dump-flows</b> [<b>-m</b>] <u>dp</u>
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow ta‐
              ble. Without <b>-m</b>, output omits match fields that a flow wildcards
              entirely; with <b>-m</b> output includes all wildcarded fields.

              This  command  is  primarily  useful for debugging Open vSwitch.
              The flow table entries that it displays are  not  OpenFlow  flow
              entries.   Instead,  they are different and considerably simpler
              flows maintained by the datapath module.  If you wish to see the
              OpenFlow flow entries, use <b>ovs-ofctl</b> <b>dump-flows</b>.

       <b>dpif/del-flows</b> <u>dp</u>
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath <u>dp</u>'s flow table  and  un‐
              derlying datapath implementation (e.g., kernel datapath module).

              This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  As
              discussed  in  <b>dpif/dump-flows</b>,  these  entries are not OpenFlow
              flow entries.

   <b>OFPROTO</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage the core OpenFlow switch  implementation  (called
       <b>ofproto</b>).

       <b>ofproto/list</b>
              Lists the names of the running ofproto instances.  These are the
              names that may be used on <b>ofproto/trace</b>.

       <b>ofproto/trace</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>dpname</u>] <u>odp</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> [<u>packet</u>]
       <b>ofproto/trace</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>bridge</u> <u>br</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> [<u>packet</u>]]
       <b>ofproto/trace-packet-out</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>dpname</u>] <u>odp</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> [<u>packet</u>] <u>actions</u>
       <b>ofproto/trace-packet-out</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>bridge</u> <u>br</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> [<u>packet</u>] <u>actions</u>
              Traces  the  path  of an imaginary packet through <u>switch</u> and re‐
              ports the path that it  took.   The  initial  treatment  of  the
              packet varies based on the command:

              •      <b>ofproto/trace</b>  looks  the  packet up in the OpenFlow flow
                     table, as if the packet had arrived on an OpenFlow port.

              •      <b>ofproto/trace-packet-out</b> applies the  specified  OpenFlow
                     <u>actions</u>,  as  if  the  packet, flow, and actions had been
                     specified in an OpenFlow ``packet-out'' request.

              The packet's headers (e.g. source and destination) and  metadata
              (e.g. input port), together called its ``flow,'' are usually all
              that  matter for the purpose of tracing a packet.  You can spec‐
              ify the flow in the following ways:

              <u>dpname</u> <u>odp</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u>
                     <u>odp</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> is a flow in the form printed by  <b>ovs-dpctl</b>(8)'s
                     <b>dump-flows</b> command.  If all of your bridges have the same
                     type, which is the common case, then you can omit <u>dpname</u>,
                     but  if  you  have  bridges of different types (say, both
                     <b>ovs-netdev</b> and <b>ovs-system</b>), then you need  to  specify  a
                     <u>dpname</u> to disambiguate.

              <u>bridge</u> <u>br</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u>
                     <u>br</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> is a flow in the form similar to that accepted by
                     <b>ovs-ofctl</b>(8)'s  <b>add-flow</b>  command.  (This is not an Open‐
                     Flow flow: besides other differences, it  never  contains
                     wildcards.)   <u>bridge</u>  names  of  the bridge through which
                     <u>br</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> should be traced.

              These commands support the following options:

              <b>--generate</b>
                     Generate a packet from the flow (see below for  more  in‐
                     formation).

              <b>--l7</b> <u>payload</u>
              <b>--l7-len</b> <u>length</u>
                     Accepted  only with <b>--generate</b> (see below for more infor‐
                     mation).

              <b>--consistent</b>
                     Accepted by <b>ofproto-trace-packet-out</b> only.  With this op‐
                     tion, the command rejects <u>actions</u> that  are  inconsistent
                     with  the  specified packet.  (An example of an inconsis‐
                     tency is attempting to strip the VLAN tag from  a  packet
                     that  does  not  have  a VLAN tag.)  Open vSwitch ignores
                     most forms of inconsistency in OpenFlow 1.0  and  rejects
                     inconsistencies  in  later versions of OpenFlow.  The op‐
                     tion is necessary because the command does not ordinarily
                     imply a particular OpenFlow version.   One  exception  is
                     that,  when <u>actions</u> includes an action that only OpenFlow
                     1.1 and later supports (such as <b>push_vlan</b>),  <b>--consistent</b>
                     is automatically enabled.

              <b>--ct-next</b> <u>flags</u>
                     When  the  traced  flow  triggers  conntrack actions, <b>of‐</b>
                     <b>proto/trace</b> will automatically trace  the  forked  packet
                     processing  pipeline  with user specified ct_state.  This
                     option sets the ct_state flags that the conntrack  module
                     will  report.  The  <u>flags</u> must be a comma- or space-sepa‐
                     rated list of the following connection tracking flags:

                     •      <b>trk</b>: Include to indicate connection  tracking  has
                            taken place.

                     •      <b>new</b>: Include to indicate a new flow.

                     •      <b>est</b>: Include to indicate an established flow.

                     •      <b>rel</b>: Include to indicate a related flow.

                     •      <b>rpl</b>: Include to indicate a reply flow.

                     •      <b>inv</b>:  Include  to indicate a connection entry in a
                            bad state.

                     •      <b>dnat</b>: Include to indicate a packet whose  destina‐
                            tion IP address has been changed.

                     •      <b>snat</b>: Include to indicate a packet whose source IP
                            address has been changed.

                     When  <b>--ct-next</b>  is  unspecified, or when there are fewer
                     <b>--ct-next</b> options than ct <u>actions</u>, the <u>flags</u>  default  to
                     <b>trk,new</b>.

              Most commonly, one specifies only a flow, using one of the forms
              above,  but sometimes one might need to specify an actual packet
              instead of just a flow:

              Side effects.
                     Some actions have side effects.  For example, the  <b>normal</b>
                     action  can  update the MAC learning table, and the <b>learn</b>
                     action can change OpenFlow tables.   The  trace  commands
                     only perform side effects when a packet is specified.  If
                     you want side effects to take place, then you must supply
                     a packet.

                     (Output  actions  are obviously side effects too, but the
                     trace commands never execute them, even when  one  speci‐
                     fies a packet.)

              Incomplete information.
                     Most  of the time, Open vSwitch can figure out everything
                     about the path of a packet using just the  flow,  but  in
                     some  special  circumstances it needs to look at parts of
                     the packet that are not included in the flow.  When  this
                     is the case, and you do not supply a packet, then a trace
                     command will tell you it needs a packet.

              If  you  wish  to include a packet as part of a trace operation,
              there are two ways to do it:

              <b>--generate</b>
                     This option, added to one of the ways to specify  a  flow
                     already described, causes Open vSwitch to internally gen‐
                     erate  a  packet  with the flow described and then to use
                     that packet.  If your goal is to  execute  side  effects,
                     then <b>--generate</b> is the easiest way to do it, but <b>--gener‐</b>
                     <b>ate</b>  is not a good way to fill in incomplete information,
                     because it generates packets based on only the  flow  in‐
                     formation,  which  means  that  the packets really do not
                     have any more information than the flow.

                     By default, for protocols that allow  arbitrary  L7  pay‐
                     loads, the generated packet has 64 bytes of payload.  Use
                     <b>--l7-len</b> to change the payload length, or <b>--l7</b> to specify
                     the exact contents of the payload.

              <u>packet</u> This  form  supplies  an explicit <u>packet</u> as a sequence of
                     hex digits.  An Ethernet frame is at least 14 bytes long,
                     so there must be at least 28 hex digits.   Obviously,  it
                     is inconvenient to type in the hex digits by hand, so the
                     <b>ovs-pcap</b>(1) and <b>ovs-tcpundump</b>(1) utilities provide easier
                     ways.

                     With  this  form,  packet  headers are extracted directly
                     from <u>packet</u>, so the <u>odp</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u> or  <u>br</u><b>_</b><u>flow</u>  should  specify
                     only metadata. The metadata can be:

                     <u>skb</u><b>_</b><u>priority</u>
                            Packet QoS priority.

                     <u>pkt</u><b>_</b><u>mark</u>
                            Mark of the packet.

                     <u>ct</u><b>_</b><u>state</u>
                            Connection state of the packet.

                     <u>ct</u><b>_</b><u>zone</u>
                            Connection tracking zone for packet.

                     <u>ct</u><b>_</b><u>mark</u>
                            Connection mark of the packet.

                     <u>ct</u><b>_</b><u>label</u>
                            Connection label of the packet.

                     <u>tun</u><b>_</b><u>id</u> The tunnel ID on which the packet arrived.

                     <u>in</u><b>_</b><u>port</u>
                            The port on which the packet arrived.

              The  in_port  value is kernel datapath port number for the first
              format and OpenFlow port number for the second format. The  num‐
              bering  of  these two types of port usually differs and there is
              no relationship.

       Usage examples:

           <b>Trace</b> <b>an</b> <b>unicast</b> <b>ICMP</b> <b>echo</b> <b>request</b> <b>on</b> <b>ingress</b> <b>port</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>destination</b>

   <b>VLOG</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s logging settings.

       <b>vlog/set</b> [<u>spec</u>]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for
              every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a  list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> com‐
                     mand on <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.

                     On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   <b>off</b>  filters  out all messages.  See <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

              Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>,  logging  to  a  file
              will  not  take  place  unless <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> was invoked with the
              <b>--log-file</b> option.

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       <b>vlog/set</b> <b>PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
              Sets the log pattern  for  <u>destination</u>  to  <u>pattern</u>.   Refer  to
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>(8) for a description of the valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>vlog/list</b>
              Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.

       <b>vlog/list-pattern</b>
              Lists logging patterns used for each destination.

       <b>vlog/close</b>
              Causes  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to close its log file, if it is open.  (Use
              <b>vlog/reopen</b> to reopen it later.)

       <b>vlog/reopen</b>
              Causes <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> to close its log file, if it  is  open,  and
              then  reopen  it.   (This is useful after rotating log files, to
              cause a new log file to be used.)

              This has no effect unless  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>  was  invoked  with  the
              <b>--log-file</b> option.

       <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b> [<u>module</u>]...
       <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit</b> [<u>module</u>]...
              By  default,  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> limits the rate at which certain mes‐
              sages can be logged.  When a  message  would  appear  more  fre‐
              quently  than  the  limit,  it  is  suppressed.  This saves disk
              space, makes logs easier to read, and speeds up  execution,  but
              occasionally  troubleshooting  requires more detail.  Therefore,
              <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b> allows rate limits to be disabled at the
              level of an individual log module.  Specify one or  more  module
              names, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command.  Specifying either
              no  module  names at all or the keyword <b>any</b> disables rate limits
              for every log module.

              The <b>vlog/enable-rate-limit</b> command, whose syntax is the same  as
              <b>vlog/disable-rate-limit</b>,  can  be used to re-enable a rate limit
              that was previously disabled.

   <b>MEMORY</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands report memory usage.

       <b>memory/show</b>
              Displays some basic statistics about <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s  memory  us‐
              age.  <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> also logs this information soon after startup
              and periodically as its memory consumption grows.

   <b>COVERAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands manage <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>'s ``coverage counters,'' which count
       the  number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
       In addition to these commands, <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> automatically logs coverage
       counter values, at <b>INFO</b> level, when it detects that the  daemon's  main
       loop takes unusually long to run.

       Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and debug‐
       ging.

       <b>coverage/show</b>
              Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds,
              the  last  minute and the last hour, and the total counts of all
              of the coverage counters.

       <b>coverage/read-counter</b> <u>counter</u>
              Displays the total count for the given coverage <u>counter</u>.

   <b>OPENVSWITCH</b> <b>TUNNELING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands query and modify OVS tunnel components.

       <b>ovs/route/add</b> <u>ip</u><b>/</b><u>plen</u> <u>output</u><b>_</b><u>bridge</u> <b>[</b><u>gw</u><b>]</b> <b>[pkt_mark=</b><u>mark</u><b>]</b> <b>[src=</b><u>src</u><b>_</b><u>ip</u><b>]</b>
              Adds <u>ip</u>/<u>plen</u> route  to  vswitchd  routing  table.  <u>output</u><b>_</b><u>bridge</u>
              needs  to  be  OVS  bridge  name.  This command is useful if OVS
              cached routes does not look right.

       <b>ovs/route/show</b>
              Print all routes in OVS  routing  table,  This  includes  routes
              cached from system routing table and user configured routes.

       <b>ovs/route/del</b> <b>ip/plen</b> <b>[pkt_mark=mark]</b>
              Delete ip/plen route from OVS routing table.

       <b>tnl/neigh/show</b>

       <b>tnl/arp/show</b>
              OVS  builds  ARP  cache  by  snooping are messages. This command
              shows ARP cache table.

       <b>tnl/neigh/set</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>ip</u> <u>mac</u>

       <b>tnl/arp/set</b> <u>bridge</u> <u>ip</u> <u>mac</u>
              Adds or modifies an ARP cache entry in  <u>bridge</u>,  mapping  <u>ip</u>  to
              <u>mac</u>.

       <b>tnl/neigh/flush</b>

       <b>tnl/arp/flush</b>
              Flush ARP table.

       <b>tnl/neigh/aging</b> <b>[</b><u>seconds</u><b>]</b>

       <b>tnl/arp/aging</b> <b>[</b><u>seconds</u><b>]</b>
              Changes  the  aging time. The accepted values of <u>seconds</u> are be‐
              tween 1 and 3600. The new entries will get the value  as  speci‐
              fied in <u>seconds</u>. For the existing entries, the aging time is up‐
              dated only if the current expiration is greater than <u>seconds</u>.

              If used without arguments, it prints the current aging value.

       <b>tnl/egress_port_range</b> <b>[num1]</b> <b>[num2]</b>
              Set  range  for  UDP source port used for UDP based Tunnels. For
              example VxLAN. If case of zero  arguments  this  command  prints
              current range in use.

<b>OPENFLOW</b> <b>IMPLEMENTATION</b>
       This section documents aspects of OpenFlow for which the OpenFlow spec‐
       ification requires documentation.

   <b>Packet</b> <b>buffering.</b>
       The OpenFlow specification, version 1.2, says:

              Switches  that  implement  buffering  are  expected  to  expose,
              through documentation, both the amount of  available  buffering,
              and the length of time before buffers may be reused.

       Open vSwitch does not maintains any packet buffers.

   <b>Bundle</b> <b>lifetime</b>
       The OpenFlow specification, version 1.4, says:

              If  the  switch  does  not  receive  any  OFPT_BUNDLE_CONTROL or
              OFPT_BUNDLE_ADD_MESSAGE message for an opened  bundle_id  for  a
              switch  defined  time  greater  than  1s, it may send an ofp_er‐
              ror_msg with OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED type and  OFPBFC_TIMEOUT  code.
              If the switch does not receive any new message in a bundle apart
              from  echo request and replies for a switch defined time greater
              than 1s, it may send an ofp_error_msg  with  OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED
              type and OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code.

       Open  vSwitch  implements  default  idle bundle lifetime of 10 seconds.
       (This  is  configurable  via  <b>other-config:bundle-idle-timeout</b>  in  the
       <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. See <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) for details.)

<b>LIMITS</b>
       We  believe these limits to be accurate as of this writing.  These lim‐
       its assume the use of the Linux kernel datapath.

       •      <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> started through  <b>ovs-ctl</b>(8)  provides  a  limit  of
              65535 file descriptors.  The limits on the number of bridges and
              ports  is decided by the availability of file descriptors.  With
              the Linux kernel datapath, creation of a single bridge  consumes
              three  file  descriptors  and  each port consumes one additional
              file descriptor.  Other platforms  may  have  different  limita‐
              tions.

       •      8,192  MAC  learning  entries  per bridge, by default.  (This is
              configurable via <b>other-config:mac-table-size</b> in the  <b>Bridge</b>  ta‐
              ble.  See <b>ovs-vswitchd.conf.db</b>(5) for details.)

       •      Kernel flows are limited only by memory available to the kernel.
              Performance  will  degrade  beyond  1,048,576  kernel  flows per
              bridge with a 32-bit kernel, beyond 262,144 with a  64-bit  ker‐
              nel.  (<b>ovs-vswitchd</b> should never install anywhere near that many
              flows.)

       •      OpenFlow  flows  are  limited only by available memory.  Perfor‐
              mance is linear in the number of unique wildcard patterns.  That
              is, an OpenFlow table that contains many flows that all match on
              the same fields in the same way has a constant-time lookup,  but
              a  table that contains many flows that match on different fields
              requires lookup time linear in the number of flows.

       •      255 ports per bridge participating in 802.1D Spanning Tree  Pro‐
              tocol.

       •      32 mirrors per bridge.

       •      15  bytes  for  the name of a port, for ports implemented in the
              Linux kernel.  Ports implemented in  userspace,  such  as  patch
              ports,  do  not  have  an arbitrary length limitation.  OpenFlow
              also limit port names to 15 bytes.
