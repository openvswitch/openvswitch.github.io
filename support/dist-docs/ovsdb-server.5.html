<b>NAME</b>
       ovsdb-server - _Server database schema

       Every  <b>ovsdb-server</b>  (version 2.9 or later) always hosts an instance of
       this schema, which holds information on the status and configuration of
       the server itself. This database is read-only. This  manpage  describes
       the schema for this database.

<b>TABLE</b> <b>SUMMARY</b>
       The  following list summarizes the purpose of each of the tables in the
       <b>_Server</b> database.  Each table is described in more detail  on  a  later
       page.

       Table     Purpose
       <b>Database</b>  Databases.

<b>Database</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       This  table describes the databases hosted by the database server, with
       one row per database. As its database configuration and status changes,
       the server automatically and immediately updates the table to match.

       The OVSDB protocol specified in RFC 7047 does not provide a way for  an
       OVSDB  client  to  find  out about some kinds of configuration changes,
       such as about databases added or removed while a client is connected to
       the server, or databases changing between read/write and read-only  due
       to  a transition between active and backup roles. This table provides a
       solution: clients can monitor the table’s contents to  find  out  about
       important changes.

       Traditionally,  <b>ovsdb-server</b> disconnects all of its clients when a sig‐
       nificant configuration change occurs, because this prompts a well-writ‐
       ten client to reassess what is available from the server when it recon‐
       nects. Because this table provides an alternative  and  more  efficient
       way  to  find  out  about  those  changes,  OVS 2.9 also introduces the
       <b>set_db_change_aware</b>  RPC,  documented  in  <b>ovsdb-server</b>(7),  to   allow
       clients to suppress this disconnection behavior.

       When a database is removed from the server, in addition to <b>Database</b> ta‐
       ble  updates,  the  server sends <b>canceled</b> messages, as described in RFC
       7047 section 4.1.4, in reply to outstanding transactions  for  the  re‐
       moved database. The server also cancels any outstanding monitoring ini‐
       tiated  by  <b>monitor</b>  or <b>monitor_cond</b> requested on the removed database,
       sending the <b>monitor_canceled</b> RPC  described  in  <b>ovsdb-server</b>(7).  Only
       clients  that  disable  disconnection  with <b>set_db_change_aware</b> receive
       these messages.

       Clients can use the <b>_uuid</b> column in this table as a generation  number.
       The  server  generates  a fresh <b>_uuid</b> every time it adds a database, so
       that removing and then re-adding a database to the  server  causes  its
       row <b>_uuid</b> to change.

   <b>Summary:</b>
       <b>name</b>                          string
       <b>model</b>                         string,   one  of  <b>clustered</b>,  <b>relay</b>,  or
                                     <b>standalone</b>
       <b>schema</b>                        optional string
       <b>connected</b>                     boolean
       <u>Clustered</u> <u>Databases:</u>
         <b>leader</b>                      boolean
         <b>cid</b>                         optional uuid
         <b>sid</b>                         optional uuid
         <b>index</b>                       optional integer

   <b>Details:</b>
       <b>name</b>: string
              The database’s name, as specified in its schema.

       <b>model</b>: string, one of <b>clustered</b>, <b>relay</b>, or <b>standalone</b>
              The storage model: <b>standalone</b> for a standalone or  active-backup
              database,  <b>clustered</b> for a clustered database, <b>relay</b> for a relay
              database.

       <b>schema</b>: optional string
              The database schema, as a JSON string. In the case  of  a  clus‐
              tered  database,  this  is  empty  until it finishes joining its
              cluster. In the case of a relay database, this is empty until it
              connects to the relay source.

       <b>connected</b>: boolean
              True if the database is connected to its storage.  A  standalone
              database  is always connected. A clustered database is connected
              if the server is in contact with a majority of  its  cluster.  A
              relay database is connected if the server is in contact with the
              relay  source, i.e. is connected to the server it syncs from. An
              unconnected database cannot be modified and its  data  might  be
              unavailable or stale.

     <u>Clustered</u> <u>Databases:</u>

       These  columns are most interesting and in some cases only relevant for
       clustered databases, that is, those where the  <b>model</b>  column  is  <b>clus‐</b>
       <b>tered</b>.

       <b>leader</b>: boolean
              True  if the database is the leader in its cluster. For a stand‐
              alone or active-backup database, this is always true. For a  re‐
              lay database, this is always false.

       <b>cid</b>: optional uuid
              The  cluster  ID for this database, which is the same for all of
              the servers that host this particular clustered database. For  a
              standalone, active-backup or relay database, this is empty.

       <b>sid</b>: optional uuid
              The  server ID for this database, different for each server that
              hosts a particular clustered database. A server that hosts  more
              than  one  clustered  database will have a different <b>sid</b> in each
              one. For a standalone, active-backup or relay database, this  is
              empty.

       <b>index</b>: optional integer
              For  a  clustered database, the index of the log entry currently
              exposed to clients. For a given server, this increases monotoni‐
              cally. When a client switches from one server to  another  in  a
              cluster,  it  can ensure that it never sees an older snapshot of
              data by avoiding servers that have <b>index</b> less than  the  largest
              value they have already observed.

              For  a  standalone,  active-backup  or  relay  database, this is
              empty.
