<u>OVS-TEST</u>(8)                      Open vSwitch                      <u>OVS-TEST</u>(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       ovs-test  -  Check Linux drivers for performance, vlan and L3 tunneling
       problems

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ovs-test</b> -s <u>port</u>

       <b>ovs-test</b> -c <u>server1</u> <u>server2</u> [<b>-b</b> <u>targetbandwidth</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>testinterval</u>] [<b>-d</b>]
              [<b>-l</b> <u>vlantag</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>tunnelmodes</u>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>ovs-test</b> program may be used to check for problems  sending  802.1Q
       or GRE traffic that Open vSwitch may uncover. These problems, for exam‐
       ple, can occur when Open vSwitch is used to send 802.1Q traffic through
       physical  interfaces  running  certain  drivers of certain Linux kernel
       versions.  To run a test, configure IP addresses on <u>server1</u> and <u>server2</u>
       for interfaces you intended to test. These interfaces could also be al‐
       ready configured OVS bridges that have a physical interface attached to
       them. Then, on one of the nodes, run <b>ovs-test</b> in server mode and on the
       other node run it in client mode. The client will connect  to  <b>ovs-test</b>
       server  and  schedule  tests  between both of them. The <b>ovs-test</b> client
       will perform UDP and TCP tests.

       UDP tests can report packet loss and  achieved  bandwidth  for  various
       datagram sizes. By default target bandwidth for UDP tests is 1Mbit/s.

       TCP  tests  report  only  achieved  bandwidth, because kernel TCP stack
       takes care of flow control and packet loss. TCP tests are essential  to
       detect potential TSO related issues.

       To  determine  whether  Open  vSwitch is encountering any problems, the
       user must compare packet loss and achieved bandwidth in a  setup  where
       traffic  is  being  directly sent and in one where it is not. If in the
       802.1Q or L3 tunneled tests both <b>ovs-test</b> processes are unable to  com‐
       municate  or  the  achieved  bandwidth is much lower compared to direct
       setup, then, most likely, Open vSwitch has encountered  a  pre-existing
       kernel or driver bug.

       Some examples of the types of problems that may be encountered are:

       • When NICs use VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a pointer to a
         <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>group</u> when reporting the stripped tag to the networking core. If
         no  <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>group</u>  is  in  use then some drivers just drop the extracted
         tag.  Drivers are supposed to only enable stripping if  a  <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>group</u>
         is registered but not all of them do that.

       • On receive, some drivers handle priority tagged packets specially and
         don’t  pass  the  tag  onto the network stack at all, so Open vSwitch
         never has a chance to see it.

       • Some drivers size their receive buffers based on whether a <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>group</u>
         is enabled, meaning that a maximum size packet with a VLAN  tag  will
         not fit if no <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>group</u> is configured.

       • On  transmit, some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration will be used
         if it is available, which can only be done if a <u>vlan</u><b>_</b><u>group</u> is config‐
         ured. In these cases, the driver may fail to  parse  the  packet  and
         correctly setup checksum offloading or TSO.

       <b>Client</b> <b>Mode</b>
              An <b>ovs-test</b> client will connect to two <b>ovs-test</b> servers and will
              ask  them to exchange test traffic. It is also possible to spawn
              an <b>ovs-test</b> server automatically from the client.

       <b>Server</b> <b>Mode</b>
              To conduct tests, two <b>ovs-test</b> servers must be  running  on  two
              different  hosts  where  the client can connect. The actual test
              traffic is exchanged only between both <b>ovs-test</b> servers.  It  is
              recommended  that  both  servers  have their IP addresses in the
              same subnet, otherwise one would have to make sure that  routing
              is set up correctly.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-s</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;,</b> <b>--server</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Run  in server mode and wait for the client to establish XML RPC
              Control Connection on this TCP port. It is recommended  to  have
              <u>ethtool(8)</u> installed on the server so that it could retrieve in‐
              formation about the NIC driver.

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;server1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;server2&gt;,</b> <b>--client</b> <b>&lt;server1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;server2&gt;</b>
              Run  in  client  mode  and  schedule  tests  between <u>server1</u> and
              <u>server2</u>, where each server must be given in the  following  for‐
              mat:

                 OuterIP[:OuterPort],InnerIP[/Mask][:InnerPort].

              The  <u>OuterIP</u>  must be already assigned to the physical interface
              which is going to be tested. This is the IP address where client
              will  try  to  establish  XML  RPC  connection.  If  <u>OuterIP</u>  is
              127.0.0.1  then client will automatically spawn a local instance
              of <b>ovs-test</b> server.  OuterPort is TCP port where server is  lis‐
              tening  for  incoming  XML/RPC  control  connections to schedule
              tests (by default it is 15531). The <b>ovs-test</b> will  automatically
              assign  <u>InnerIP[/Mask]</u> to the interfaces that will be created on
              the  fly  for  testing  purposes.  It  is  important  that   <u>In‐</u>
              <u>nerIP[/Mask]</u>  does  not  interfere  with already existing IP ad‐
              dresses on both <b>ovs-test</b> servers and client. InnerPort  is  port
              which  will  be  used  by server to listen for test traffic that
              will be encapsulated (by default it is 15532).

       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;targetbandwidth&gt;,</b> <b>--bandwidth</b> <b>&lt;targetbandwidth&gt;</b>
              Target bandwidth for UDP  tests.  The  targetbandwidth  must  be
              given  in  bits per second. It is possible to use postfix <u>M</u> or <u>K</u>
              to alter the target bandwidth magnitude.

       <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;testinterval&gt;,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;testinterval&gt;</b>
              How long each test should run. By default 5 seconds.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

       The following test modes are supported by <b>ovs-test</b>. It is  possible  to
       combine multiple of them in a single <b>ovs-test</b> invocation.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--direct</b>
              Perform direct tests between both OuterIP addresses. These tests
              could  be  used as a reference to compare 802.1Q or L3 tunneling
              test results.

       <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;vlantag&gt;,</b> <b>--vlan-tag</b> <b>&lt;vlantag&gt;</b>
              Perform 802.1Q tests between both servers. These tests will cre‐
              ate a temporary OVS bridge, if  necessary,  and  attach  a  VLAN
              tagged port to it for testing purposes.

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;tunnelmodes&gt;,</b> <b>--tunnel-modes</b> <b>&lt;tunnelmodes&gt;</b>
              Perform  L3 tunneling tests. The given argument is a comma sepa‐
              rated string that specifies all the L3 tunnel modes that  should
              be  tested  (e.g.  gre). The L3 tunnels are terminated on inter‐
              face that has the OuterIP address assigned.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       On host 1.2.3.4 start <b>ovs-test</b> in server mode:

          ovs-test -s 15531

       On host 1.2.3.5 start <b>ovs-test</b> in client mode and do direct,  VLAN  and
       GRE tests between both nodes:

          ovs-test -c 127.0.0.1,1.1.1.1/30 1.2.3.4,1.1.1.2/30 -d -l 123 -t
          gre
