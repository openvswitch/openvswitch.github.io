       <b>ovs-appctl</b> <b>--help</b>

       <b>ovs-appctl</b> <b>--version</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Open vSwitch daemons accept certain  commands  at  runtime  to  control
       their behavior and query their settings.  Every daemon accepts a common
       set  of  commands documented under <u>Common</u> <u>Commands</u> below.  Some daemons
       support  additional  commands  documented  in   their   own   manpages.
       <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> in particular accepts a number of additional commands doc‐
       umented in <b>ovs-vswitchd(8)</b>.

       The  <b>ovs-appctl</b> program provides a simple way to invoke these commands.
       The command to be sent is specified on  <b>ovs-appctl</b>’s  command  line  as
       non-option arguments.  <b>ovs-appctl</b> sends the command and prints the dae‐
       mon’s response on standard output.

       In normal use only a single option is accepted:

       • <b>-t</b> <u>target</u> or <b>--target=</b><u>target</u>

         Tells <b>ovs-appctl</b> which daemon to contact.

         If <u>target</u> begins with <b>/</b> it must name a Unix domain socket on which an
         Open vSwitch daemon is listening for control channel connections.  By
         default,  each  daemon  listens on a Unix domain socket in the rundir
         (e.g. <b>/run</b>) named <b>&lt;program&gt;.&lt;pid&gt;.ctl</b>, where &lt;program&gt;  is  the  pro‐
         gram’s   name   and  &lt;pid&gt;  is  its  process  ID.   For  example,  if
         <b>ovs-vswitchd</b> has PID 123, it would listen on <b>ovs-vswitchd.123.ctl</b>.

         Otherwise, <b>ovs-appctl</b> looks in the rundir for a pidfile, that  is,  a
         file whose contents are the process ID of a running process as a dec‐
         imal  number,  named <u>target</u><b>.pid</b>.  (The <b>--pidfile</b> option makes an Open
         vSwitch daemon create a pidfile.)  <b>ovs-appctl</b> reads the pidfile, then
         looks in the rundir for a Unix socket named  <u>target</u><b>.&lt;pid&gt;.ctl</b>,  where
         &lt;pid&gt;  is  replaced by the process ID read from the pidfile, and uses
         that file as if it had been specified directly as the target.

         On Windows, <u>target</u> can be an absolute path to a file that contains  a
         localhost  TCP  port on which an Open vSwitch daemon is listening for
         control channel connections. By default, each daemon writes  the  TCP
         port  on  which  it is listening for control connection into the file
         <b>&lt;program&gt;.ctl</b> located inside the rundir. If <u>target</u> is not an absolute
         path, <b>ovs-appctl</b> looks in the rundir for  a  file  named  <u>target</u><b>.ctl</b>.
         The default <u>target</u> is <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

       • <b>-T</b> <u>secs</u> or <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>

         By  default, or with a <u>secs</u> of <b>0</b>, <b>ovs-appctl</b> waits forever to connect
         to the daemon and receive a response.  This option limits runtime  to
         approximately <u>secs</u> seconds.  If the timeout expires, <b>ovs-appctl</b> exits
         with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal.

       • <b>-f</b> <u>format</u> or <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>

         Tells  <b>ovs-appctl</b>  which output format to use.  By default, or with a
         <u>format</u> of <b>text</b>, <b>ovs-appctl</b> will print plain-text  for  humans.   When
         <u>format</u> is <b>json</b>, <b>ovs-appctl</b> will return a JSON document.  When <b>json</b> is
         requested,  but  a  command  has  not  implemented  JSON  output, the
         plain-text output will be wrapped in a provisional JSON document with
         the following structure:

            {"reply-format":"plain","reply":"$PLAIN_TEXT_HERE"}

       • <b>--pretty</b>

         By default, JSON output is printed as compactly  as  possible.   This
         option  causes  JSON in output to be printed in a more readable fash‐
         ion.  For example, members of objects  and  elements  of  arrays  are
         printed one per line, with indentation.  Requires <b>--format=json</b>.

<b>COMMON</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       Every  Open vSwitch daemon supports a common set of commands, which are
       documented in this section.

   <b>General</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands display daemon-specific commands and  the  running  ver‐
       sion.   Note  that  these  commands  are  different from the <b>--help</b> and
       <b>--version</b> options that return information about the <b>ovs-appctl</b>  utility
       itself.

       • <b>list-commands</b>

         Lists the commands supported by the target.

       • <b>version</b>

         Displays the version and compilation date of the target.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Commands</b>
       Open  vSwitch  has  several log levels.  The highest-severity log level
       is:

       • <b>off</b>

         No message is ever logged at this level, so setting a logging  desti‐
         nation’s log level to <b>off</b> disables logging to that destination.

       The  following  log levels, in order of descending severity, are avail‐
       able:

       • <b>emer</b>

         A major failure forced a process to abort.

       • <b>err</b>

         A high-level operation or a  subsystem  failed.   Attention  is  war‐
         ranted.

       • <b>warn</b>

         A low-level operation failed, but higher-level subsystems may be able
         to recover.

       • <b>info</b>

         Information  that  may  be  useful in retrospect when investigating a
         problem.

       • <b>dbg</b>

         Information useful only to someone with intricate  knowledge  of  the
         system,  or that would commonly cause too-voluminous log output.  Log
         messages at this level are not logged by default.

       Every Open vSwitch daemon supports the following commands for examining
       and adjusting log levels:

       • <b>vlog/list</b>

         Lists the known logging modules and their current levels.

       • <b>vlog/list-pattern</b>

         Lists logging pattern used for each destination.

       • <b>vlog/set</b> [<u>spec</u>]

         Sets logging levels.  Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for  every
         module  and  destination  to <b>dbg</b>.  Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a list of words
         separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from each category
         below:

         • A valid module name, as  displayed  by  the  <b>vlog/list</b>  command  on
           <b>ovs-appctl(8)</b>, limits the log level change to the specified module.

         • <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level change to only to
           the system log, to the console, or to a file, respectively.

           On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is only useful if  <u>target</u>  was  started
           with the <b>--syslog-target</b> option (it has no effect otherwise).

         • <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log level.  Mes‐
           sages  of the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages
           of lower severity will be filtered out.  <b>off</b> filters out  all  mes‐
           sages.

         Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

         Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file will not
         take  place  unless  the  target  application  was  invoked  with the
         <b>--log-file</b> option.

         For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted  within
         <u>spec</u> but it has no effect.

       • <b>vlog/set</b> <b>PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u>:<u>pattern</u>

         Sets the log pattern for <u>destination</u> to <u>pattern</u>.  Each time a message
         is  logged  to  <u>destination</u>, <u>pattern</u> determines the message’s format‐
         ting.  Most characters in <u>pattern</u> are copied literally  to  the  log,
         but special escapes beginning with <b>%</b> are expanded as follows:

         • <b>%A</b>

           The name of the application logging the message, e.g. <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

         • <b>%B</b>

           The RFC5424 syslog PRI of the message.

         • <b>%c</b>

           The  name of the module (as shown by <b>ovs-appctl</b> <b>--list</b>) logging the
           message.

         • <b>%d</b>

           The current date and time in ISO 8601 format (<b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> <b>HH:MM:SS</b>).

         • <b>%d{</b><u>format</u><b>}</b>

           The current date and time in the specified <u>format</u>, which takes  the
           same  format as the <b>template</b> argument to <b>strftime(3)</b>.  As an exten‐
           sion, any <b>#</b> characters in <u>format</u> will  be  replaced  by  fractional
           seconds,  e.g.  use  <b>%H:%M:%S.###</b>  for the time to the nearest mil‐
           lisecond.  Sub-second times are only approximate and currently dec‐
           imal places after the third will always be reported as zero.

         • <b>%D</b>

           The current UTC date  and  time  in  ISO  8601  format  (<b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>
           <b>HH:MM:SS</b>).

         • <b>%D{</b><u>format</u><b>}</b>

           The  current UTC date and time in the specified <u>format</u>, which takes
           the same format as the <b>template</b> argument to <b>strftime(3)</b>.   Supports
           the same extension for sub-second resolution as <b>%d{...}</b>.

         • <b>%E</b>

           The hostname of the node running the application.

         • <b>%m</b>

           The message being logged.

         • <b>%N</b>

           A serial number for this message within this run of the program, as
           a decimal number.  The first message a program logs has serial num‐
           ber 1, the second one has serial number 2, and so on.

         • <b>%n</b>

           A new-line.

         • <b>%p</b>

           The level at which the message is logged, e.g. <b>DBG</b>.

         • <b>%P</b>

           The program’s process ID (pid), as a decimal number.

         • <b>%r</b>

           The  number  of milliseconds elapsed from the start of the applica‐
           tion to the time the message was logged.

         • <b>%t</b>

           The subprogram name, that is, an identifying name for  the  process
           or  thread  that  emitted  the log message, such as <b>monitor</b> for the
           process used for <b>--monitor</b> or  <b>main</b>  for  the  primary  process  or
           thread in a program.

         • <b>%T</b>

           The subprogram name enclosed in parentheses, e.g. <b>(monitor)</b>, or the
           empty string for the primary process or thread in a program.

         • <b>%%</b>

           A literal <b>%</b>.

         A few options may appear between the <b>%</b> and the format specifier char‐
         acter, in this order:

         • <b>-</b>

           Left  justify the escape’s expansion within its field width.  Right
           justification is the default.

         • <b>0</b>

           Pad the field to the field width with <b>0</b> characters.   Padding  with
           spaces is the default.

         • <u>width</u>

           A  number specifies the minimum field width.  If the escape expands
           to fewer characters than <u>width</u> then it is padded to fill the  field
           width.  (A field wider than <u>width</u> is not truncated to fit.)

         The  default  pattern  for  console  and  file output is <b>%D{%Y-%m-%dT</b>
         <b>%H:%M:%SZ}|%05N|%c|%p|%m</b>; for syslog output, <b>%05N|%c|%p|%m</b>.

         Daemons written in Python (e.g. <b>ovs-monitor-ipsec</b>) do not allow  con‐
         trol over the log pattern.

       • <b>vlog/set</b> <b>FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>

         Sets  the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be one of
         <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>,
         <b>ntp</b>,  <b>audit</b>,  <b>alert</b>,  <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>,
         <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>.

       • <b>vlog/close</b>

         Causes the daemon to close  its  log  file,  if  it  is  open.   (Use
         <b>vlog/reopen</b> to reopen it later.)

       • <b>vlog/reopen</b>

         Causes  the daemon to close its log file, if it is open, and then re‐
         open it.  (This is useful after rotating log files, to  cause  a  new
         log file to be used.)

         This has no effect if the target application was not invoked with the
         <b>--log-file</b> option.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

<b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       <b>ovs-appctl</b>   can   control   all   Open   vSwitch   daemons,  including
       <b>ovs-vswitchd(8)</b> and <b>ovsdb-server(1)</b>.
