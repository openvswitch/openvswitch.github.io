NAME
       ovs-vswitchd - Open vSwitch daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ovs-vswitchd [database]

DESCRIPTION
       A  daemon that manages and controls any number of Open vSwitch switches
       on the local machine.

       The  database  argument  specifies   how   ovs-vswitchd   connects   to
       ovsdb-server.   database  may  be an OVSDB active or passive connection
       method,  as  described  in  ovsdb(7).   The  default  is  unix:/usr/lo‐
       cal/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock.

       ovs-vswitchd  retrieves its configuration from database at startup.  It
       sets up Open vSwitch datapaths and then operates switching across  each
       bridge  described in its configuration files.  As the database changes,
       ovs-vswitchd automatically updates its configuration to match.

       ovs-vswitchd switches may be configured with any of the following  fea‐
       tures:

       •      L2 switching with MAC learning.

       •      NIC  bonding  with  automatic  fail-over and source MAC-based TX
              load balancing ("SLB").

       •      802.1Q VLAN support.

       •      Port mirroring, with optional VLAN tagging.

       •      NetFlow v5 flow logging.

       •      sFlow(R) monitoring.

       •      Connectivity to an external OpenFlow controller, such as NOX.

       Only a single instance of ovs-vswitchd is intended to run at a time.  A
       single ovs-vswitchd can manage any number of switch  instances,  up  to
       the maximum number of supported Open vSwitch datapaths.

       ovs-vswitchd  does  all  the necessary management of Open vSwitch data‐
       paths itself.  Thus, ovs-dpctl(8) (and its userspace datapath  counter‐
       parts  accessible  via  ovs-appctl  dpctl/command)  are not needed with
       ovs-vswitchd and should not be used because they can interfere with its
       operation.  These tools are still useful for diagnostics.

       An Open vSwitch datapath kernel module must be loaded for  ovs-vswitchd
       to  be  useful.   Refer to the documentation for instructions on how to
       build and load the Open vSwitch kernel module.

OPTIONS
       --mlockall
              Causes ovs-vswitchd to call the mlockall() function, to  attempt
              to  lock all of its process memory into physical RAM, preventing
              the kernel from paging any of its memory to disk.  This helps to
              avoid networking interruptions due to system memory pressure.

              Some systems do not support mlockall() at all, and other systems
              only allow privileged users, such as the superuser, to  use  it.
              ovs-vswitchd emits a log message if mlockall() is unavailable or
              unsuccessful.

   DPDK Options
       For  details  on  initializing ovs-vswitchd to use DPDK ports, refer to
       the documentation or ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5).

   DPDK HW Access Options
       --hw-rawio-access
              Tells ovs-vswitchd to retain the  CAP_SYS_RAWIO  capability,  to
              allow  userspace  drivers  access  to raw hardware memory.  This
              will also allow the ovs-vswitchd daemon to call iopl() and  iop‐
              erm() functions as well as access memory devices to set port ac‐
              cess.  This is a very powerful capability, so generally only en‐
              able as needed for specific hardware (for example mlx5 with full
              hardware offload via rte_flow).

   Daemon Options
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       --pidfile[=pidfile]
              Causes a file (by default, ovs-vswitchd.pid) to be created indi‐
              cating  the PID of the running process.  If the pidfile argument
              is not specified, or if it does not begin with  /,  then  it  is
              created in /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch.

              If --pidfile is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       --overwrite-pidfile
              By  default,  when --pidfile is specified and the specified pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              ovs-vswitchd  refuses  to start.  Specify --overwrite-pidfile to
              cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When --pidfile is not specified, this option has no effect.

       --detach
              Runs ovs-vswitchd as a background process.  The  process  forks,
              and  in  the  child it starts a new session, closes the standard
              file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging
              to the console), and changes its current directory to  the  root
              (unless --no-chdir is specified).  After the child completes its
              initialization,  the  parent  exits.  ovs-vswitchd detaches only
              after it has connected to the database,  retrieved  the  initial
              configuration, and set up that configuration.

       --monitor
              Creates  an  additional process to monitor the ovs-vswitchd dae‐
              mon.  If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates  a  pro‐
              gramming  error  (SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIG‐
              PIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ)  then  the  monitor  process
              starts  a  new  copy of it.  If the daemon dies or exits for an‐
              other reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with --detach, but  it  also  func‐
              tions without it.

       --no-chdir
              By default, when --detach is specified, ovs-vswitchd changes its
              current  working  directory  to  the root directory after it de‐
              taches.  Otherwise, invoking ovs-vswitchd from a carelessly cho‐
              sen directory would prevent the  administrator  from  unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying   --no-chdir  suppresses  this  behavior,  preventing
              ovs-vswitchd from changing its current working directory.   This
              may  be useful for collecting core files, since it is common be‐
              havior to write core dumps into the  current  working  directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when --detach is not specified.

       --no-self-confinement
              By  default  daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with
              files under well-known directories determined during build.   It
              is  better  to  stick  with this default behavior and not to use
              this flag unless some other Access Control is  used  to  confine
              daemon.  Note that in contrast to other access control implemen‐
              tations  that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC
              or MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space  daemon
              itself  and hence should not be considered as a full confinement
              strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       --user Causes ovs-vswitchd to run as  a  different  user  specified  in
              "user:group",  thus  dropping most of the root privileges. Short
              forms "user" and ":group" are also allowed, with current user or
              group are assumed respectively. Only daemons started by the root
              user accepts this argument.

              On   Linux,   daemons   will   be   granted   CAP_IPC_LOCK   and
              CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES  before  dropping root privileges. Daemons
              that interact with a datapath, such  as  ovs-vswitchd,  will  be
              granted  three  additional  capabilities,  namely CAP_NET_ADMIN,
              CAP_NET_BROADCAST and CAP_NET_RAW.  The capability  change  will
              apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security
              reasons,  specifying  this  option will cause the daemon process
              not to start.

   Service Options
       The following options are valid only on Windows platform.

       --service
              Causes ovs-vswitchd to run as a service in the  background.  The
              service  should already have been created through external tools
              like SC.exe.

       --service-monitor
              Causes the ovs-vswitchd service to be automatically restarted by
              the Windows services manager if the service dies  or  exits  for
              unexpected reasons.

              When --service is not specified, this option has no effect.

   Public Key Infrastructure Options
       -p privkey.pem
       --private-key=privkey.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              ovs-vswitchd's identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       -c cert.pem
       --certificate=cert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private key specified on -p or --private-key to be  trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       -C cacert.pem
       --ca-cert=cacert.pem
              Specifies   a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate  that
              ovs-vswitchd should use to verify certificates presented  to  it
              by  SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers
              use to verify the certificate specified on -c or  --certificate,
              or  it  may  be  a different one, depending on the PKI design in
              use.)

       -C none
       --ca-cert=none
              Disables verification of certificates presented  by  SSL  peers.
              This  introduces a security risk, because it means that certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       --bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
              When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as -C or
              --ca-cert.  If it does not exist, then ovs-vswitchd will attempt
              to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL peer on its first  SSL
              connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is success‐
              ful,  it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and
              from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a cer‐
              tificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              This option exposes the SSL connection  to  a  man-in-the-middle
              attack  obtaining the initial CA certificate, but it may be use‐
              ful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certifi‐
              cate as part of the SSL certificate  chain.   The  SSL  protocol
              does not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.

       --peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM file that contains one or more additional cer‐
              tificates to send to SSL peers.  peer-cacert.pem should  be  the
              CA certificate used to sign ovs-vswitchd's own certificate, that
              is,  the  certificate  specified  on  -c  or  --certificate.  If
              ovs-vswitchd's certificate is  self-signed,  then  --certificate
              and --peer-ca-cert should specify the same file.

              This  option  is not useful in normal operation, because the SSL
              peer must already have the CA certificate for the peer  to  have
              any confidence in ovs-vswitchd's identity.  However, this offers
              a  way for a new installation to bootstrap the CA certificate on
              its first SSL connection.

   Logging Options
       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any spec, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and destination to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the  vlog/list  com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      syslog,  console,  or file, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.   (If  --detach  is specified, ovs-vswitchd
                     closes its standard file descriptors, so logging  to  the
                     console will have no effect.)

                     On  Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  --syslog-target  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      off,  emer,  err,  warn, info, or dbg, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  off filters out all  messages.   See  ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for file, logging to a file
              will not take place unless --log-file is also specified (see be‐
              low).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  --ver‐
              bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:destination:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  destination  to pattern.  Refer to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       -vFACILITY:facility
       --verbose=FACILITY:facility
              Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message.  facility  can  be
              one  of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp,
              clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, local0,  local1,  local2,
              local3,  local4, local5, local6 or local7. If this option is not
              specified, daemon is used as the default for  the  local  system
              syslog  and local0 is used while sending a message to the target
              provided via the --syslog-target option.

       --log-file[=file]
              Enables logging to a file.  If file is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name  used  if  file  is  omitted  is   /usr/local/var/log/open‐
              vswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP port on host, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The host must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

       --syslog-method=method
              Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog dae‐
              mon.  Following forms are supported:

              •      libc, use libc syslog() function.  Downside of using this
                     options  is  that libc adds fixed prefix to every message
                     before it is actually sent  to  the  syslog  daemon  over
                     /dev/log UNIX domain socket.

              •      unix:file, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possi‐
                     ble to specify arbitrary message format with this option.
                     However,  rsyslogd  8.9 and older versions use hard coded
                     parser function anyway that  limits  UNIX  domain  socket
                     use.   If  you  want to use arbitrary message format with
                     older rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
                     IP address instead.

              •      udp:ip:port, use UDP socket.  With this method it is pos‐
                     sible to use arbitrary message  format  also  with  older
                     rsyslogd.   When  sending syslog messages over UDP socket
                     extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for  ex‐
                     ample,  syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
                     the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could
                     be  interfering  with  local syslog traffic and there are
                     some security considerations that apply to  UDP  sockets,
                     but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

              •      null, discards all messages logged to syslog.

              The  default  is  taken  from  the OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD environment
              variable; if it is unset, the default is libc.

   Other Options
       --unixctl=socket
              Sets the name of the control socket on which  ovs-vswitchd  lis‐
              tens  for  runtime  management  commands (see RUNTIME MANAGEMENT
              COMMANDS, below).  If socket does not begin with /, it is inter‐
              preted  as  relative  to   /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch.    If
              --unixctl  is  not  used  at all, the default socket is /usr/lo‐
              cal/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.pid.ctl,   where   pid   is
              ovs-vswitchd's process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime man‐
              agement  commands.   A  file  is created in the absolute path as
              pointed by socket or if --unixctl is not used at all, a file  is
              created  as ovs-vswitchd.ctl in the configured OVS_RUNDIR direc‐
              tory.  The file exists just to mimic the behavior of a Unix  do‐
              main socket.

              Specifying none for socket disables the control socket feature.

       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS
       ovs-appctl(8) can send commands to a running ovs-vswitchd process.  The
       currently supported commands are described below.  The command descrip‐
       tions assume an understanding of how to configure Open vSwitch.

   GENERAL COMMANDS
       exit --cleanup
              Causes  ovs-vswitchd  to  gracefully  terminate. If --cleanup is
              specified, deletes flows from datapaths and releases other data‐
              path resources configured by ovs-vswitchd.  Otherwise,  datapath
              flows and other resources remains undeleted.  Resources of data‐
              paths  that  are  integrated into ovs-vswitchd (e.g.  the netdev
              datapath type) are always released regardless of  --cleanup  ex‐
              cept  for ports with internal type. Use --cleanup to release in‐
              ternal ports too.

       qos/show-types interface
              Queries the interface for a list of  Quality  of  Service  types
              that are configurable via Open vSwitch for the given interface.

       qos/show interface
              Queries the kernel for Quality of Service configuration and sta‐
              tistics associated with the given interface.

       bfd/show [interface]
              Displays detailed information about Bidirectional Forwarding De‐
              tection configured on interface.  If interface is not specified,
              then displays detailed information about all interfaces with BFD
              enabled.

       bfd/set-forwarding [interface] status
              Force  the  fault  status of the BFD module on interface (or all
              interfaces if none is  given)  to  be  status.   status  can  be
              "true",  "false",  or "normal" which reverts to the standard be‐
              havior.

       cfm/show [interface]
              Displays detailed information about Connectivity  Fault  Manage‐
              ment  configured  on  interface.  If interface is not specified,
              then displays detailed information about all interfaces with CFM
              enabled.

       cfm/set-fault [interface] status
              Force the fault status of the CFM module on  interface  (or  all
              interfaces  if  none  is  given)  to  be  status.  status can be
              "true", "false", or "normal" which reverts to the  standard  be‐
              havior.

       stp/tcn [bridge]
              Forces  a  topology  change event on bridge if it's running STP.
              This may cause it to send Topology Change Notifications  to  its
              peers  and flush its MAC table.  If no bridge is given, forces a
              topology change event on all bridges.

       stp/show [bridge]
              Displays detailed information about spanning tree on the bridge.
              If bridge is not specified, then displays  detailed  information
              about all bridges with STP enabled.

       rstp/tcn [bridge]
              Forces  a  topology change event on bridge if it's running RSTP.
              This may cause it to send Topology Change Notifications  to  its
              peers  and flush its MAC table.  If no bridge is given, forces a
              topology change event on all bridges.

       rstp/show [bridge]
              Displays detailed information about rapid spanning tree  on  the
              bridge.   If bridge is not specified, then displays detailed in‐
              formation about all bridges with RSTP enabled.

   BRIDGE COMMANDS
       These commands manage bridges.

       fdb/add bridge port vlan mac
              Adds mac address to a port and vlan on a  bridge.  This  utility
              can be used to pre-populate fdb table without relying on dynamic
              mac learning.

       fdb/del bridge vlan mac
              Deletes mac address from a port and vlan on a bridge.

       fdb/flush [bridge]
              Flushes  bridge  MAC address learning table, or all learning ta‐
              bles if no bridge is given.

       fdb/show bridge
              Lists each  MAC  address/VLAN  pair  learned  by  the  specified
              bridge,  along with the port on which it was learned and the age
              of the entry, in seconds.

       fdb/stats-clear [bridge]
              Clear bridge MAC address learning table statistics, or all  sta‐
              tistics if no bridge is given.

       fdb/stats-show bridge
              Show  MAC  address  learning  table statistics for the specified
              bridge.

       mdb/flush [bridge]
              Flushes bridge multicast snooping table, or all snooping  tables
              if no bridge is given.

       mdb/show bridge
              Lists  each  multicast  group/VLAN pair learned by the specified
              bridge, along with the port on which it was learned and the  age
              of the entry, in seconds.

       bridge/reconnect [bridge]
              Makes bridge drop all of its OpenFlow controller connections and
              reconnect.   If  bridge  is not specified, then all bridges drop
              their controller connections and reconnect.

              This command might be useful for debugging  OpenFlow  controller
              issues.

       bridge/dump-flows [--offload-stats] bridge
              Lists  all  flows  in bridge, including those normally hidden to
              commands such as ovs-ofctl dump-flows.  Flows set up  by  mecha‐
              nisms  such as in-band control and fail-open are hidden from the
              controller since it is not allowed to modify or  override  them.
              If  --offload-stats  are specified then also list statistics for
              offloaded packets and bytes, which are a  subset  of  the  total
              packets and bytes.

   BOND COMMANDS
       These  commands  manage  bonded ports on an Open vSwitch's bridges.  To
       understand some of these commands, it is important to understand a  de‐
       tail  of  the  bonding  implementation called ``source load balancing''
       (SLB).  Instead of directly assigning Ethernet source addresses to mem‐
       bers, the bonding implementation  computes  a  function  that  maps  an
       48-bit  Ethernet  source  addresses into an 8-bit value (a ``MAC hash''
       value).  All of the Ethernet addresses that map to a single 8-bit value
       are then assigned to a single member.

       bond/list
              Lists all of the bonds, and their members, on each bridge.

       bond/show [port]
              Lists all of the bond-specific information (updelay,  downdelay,
              time  until  the next rebalance) about the given bonded port, or
              all bonded ports if no port is given.   Also  lists  information
              about  each members: whether it is enabled or disabled, the time
              to completion of an updelay or downdelay if one is in  progress,
              whether it is the active member, the hashes assigned to the mem‐
              ber.  Any LACP information related to this bond may be found us‐
              ing the lacp/show command.

       bond/migrate port hash member
              Only  valid  for  SLB  bonds.  Assigns a given MAC hash to a new
              member.  port specifies the bond port, hash the MAC hash  to  be
              migrated (as a decimal number between 0 and 255), and member the
              new member to be assigned.

              The reassignment is not permanent: rebalancing or fail-over will
              cause  the  MAC  hash to be shifted to a new member in the usual
              manner.

              A MAC hash cannot be migrated to a disabled member.

       bond/set-active-member port member
              Sets member as the active member on port.  member must currently
              be enabled.

              The setting is not permanent: a new active member  will  be  se‐
              lected if member becomes disabled.

       bond/enable-member port member
       bond/disable-member port member
              Enables  (or  disables)  member on the given bond port, skipping
              any updelay (or downdelay).

              This setting is not permanent: it persists only until  the  car‐
              rier status of member changes.

       bond/hash mac [vlan] [basis]
              Returns the hash value which would be used for mac with vlan and
              basis if specified.

       lacp/show [port]
              Lists  all of the LACP related information about the given port:
              active or passive, aggregation key, system id, and system prior‐
              ity.  Also lists information about each member:  whether  it  is
              enabled or disabled, whether it is attached or detached, port id
              and  priority,  actor  information, and partner information.  If
              port is not specified, then displays detailed information  about
              all interfaces with CFM enabled.

       lacp/stats-show [port]
              Lists  various  stats about LACP PDUs (number of RX/TX PDUs, bad
              PDUs received) and member state (number of times its  state  ex‐
              pired/defaulted  and carrier status changed) for the given port.
              If port is not specified, then displays stats of all  interfaces
              with LACP enabled.

   DPCTL DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS
       The  primary  way to configure ovs-vswitchd is through the Open vSwitch
       database, e.g. using ovs-vsctl(8).  These commands provide a  debugging
       interface  for  managing  datapaths.   They implement the same features
       (and syntax) as ovs-dpctl(8).  Unlike ovs-dpctl(8), these commands work
       with datapaths that are integrated into ovs-vswitchd (e.g.  the  netdev
       datapath type).

       Do   not  use  commands  to  add  or  remove  or  modify  datapaths  if
       ovs-vswitchd is running because this interferes with ovs-vswitchd's own
       datapath management.

       dpctl/add-dp dp [netdev[,option]...]
              Creates datapath dp, with a local port also named dp.  This will
              fail if a network device dp already exists.

              If netdevs are specified, ovs-vswitchd  adds  them  to  the  new
              datapath, just as if add-if was specified.

       dpctl/del-dp dp
              Deletes  datapath  dp.  If dp is associated with any network de‐
              vices, they are automatically removed.

       dpctl/add-if dp netdev[,option]...
              Adds each netdev to the set of network devices datapath dp moni‐
              tors, where dp is the name of an existing datapath,  and  netdev
              is  the  name  of  one of the host's network devices, e.g. eth0.
              Once a network device has been added to a datapath, the datapath
              has complete ownership of the network device's traffic  and  the
              network device appears silent to the rest of the system.

              A  netdev  may be followed by a comma-separated list of options.
              The following options are currently supported:

              type=type
                     Specifies the type of port to add.  The default  type  is
                     system.

              port_no=port
                     Requests  a specific port number within the datapath.  If
                     this option is not specified then one will  be  automati‐
                     cally assigned.

              key=value
                     Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port's configu‐
                     ration.

              ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)  documents  the available port types and
              options.

       dpctl/set-if dp port[,option]...
              Reconfigures each port in dp as specified.   An  option  of  the
              form  key=value  adds the specified key-value option to the port
              or overrides an existing key's value.  An  option  of  the  form
              key=, that is, without a value, deletes the key-value named key.
              The  type  and  port number of a port cannot be changed, so type
              and port_no are only allowed if they match the existing configu‐
              ration.

       dpctl/del-if dp netdev...
              Removes each netdev from the list of network devices datapath dp
              monitors.

       dpctl/dump-dps
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.

       dpctl/show [-s | --statistics] [dp...]
              Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their  data‐
              path  numbers  and  a  list of ports connected to each datapath.
              (The local port is identified as port 0.)  If -s or --statistics
              is specified, then packet and byte counters are also printed for
              each port.

              The datapath numbers consists of flow stats and mega  flow  mask
              stats.

              The  "lookups"  row  displays three stats related to flow lookup
              triggered by processing incoming packets in the datapath.  "hit"
              displays number of packets matches existing flows. "missed" dis‐
              plays  the  number of packets not matching any existing flow and
              require user space processing.  "lost" displays number of  pack‐
              ets destined for user space process but subsequently dropped be‐
              fore  reaching  userspace. The sum of "hit" and "miss" equals to
              the total number of packets datapath processed.

              The "flows" row displays the number of flows in datapath.

              The "masks" row displays the mega flow mask stats. This  row  is
              omitted  for datapath not implementing mega flow. "hit" displays
              the total number of masks visited for matching incoming packets.
              "total" displays number of masks in the datapath. "hit/pkt" dis‐
              plays the average number of masks visited per packet; the  ratio
              between "hit" and total number of packets processed by the data‐
              path.

              If  one  or  more  datapaths  are specified, information on only
              those datapaths are displayed.  Otherwise, ovs-vswitchd displays
              information about all configured datapaths.

   DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING COMMANDS
       The following commands are primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.
       The flow table entries (both matches and actions) that they  work  with
       are not OpenFlow flow entries.  Instead, they are different and consid‐
       erably  simpler flows maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module.  Do
       not use  commands  to  add  or  remove  or  modify  datapath  flows  if
       ovs-vswitchd  is  running because it interferes with ovs-vswitchd's own
       datapath flow management.  Use  ovs-ofctl(8),  instead,  to  work  with
       OpenFlow flow entries.

       The  dp argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       dpctl/dump-flows [-m | --more] [--names | --no-names] [dp] [filter=fil‐
       ter] [type=type] [pmd=pmd]
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath dp's flow ta‐
              ble.  Without -m or --more, output omits  match  fields  that  a
              flow  wildcards entirely; with -m or --more, output includes all
              wildcarded fields.

              If filter=filter is specified,  only  displays  the  flows  that
              match  the  filter. filter is a flow in the form similar to that
              accepted by ovs-ofctl(8)'s add-flow command.  (This  is  not  an
              OpenFlow  flow:  besides  other  differences,  it never contains
              wildcards.)  The filter  is  also  useful  to  match  wildcarded
              fields   in   the   datapath   flow.   As   an   example,   fil‐
              ter='tcp,tp_src=100' will match  the  datapath  flow  containing
              'tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)'.

              If  pmd=pmd  is  specified, only displays flows of the specified
              pmd.  Using pmd=-1 will restrict the dump to flows from the main
              thread.  This option is only supported by  the  userspace  data‐
              path.

              If  type=type is specified, only displays flows of the specified
              types.    This   option   supported    only    for    ovs-appctl
              dpctl/dump-flows.   type  is  a  comma separated list, which can
              contain any of the following:
                 ovs - displays flows handled in the ovs dp
                 tc - displays flows handled in the tc dp
                 dpdk - displays flows fully offloaded by dpdk
                 offloaded - displays flows offloaded to the HW
                 non-offloaded - displays flows not offloaded to the HW
                 partially-offloaded - displays flows where only part of their
              proccessing is done in HW
                 all - displays all the types of flows

              By default all the types of flows are displayed.  ovs-dpctl  al‐
              ways acts as if the type was ovs.

       dpctl/add-flow [dp] flow actions

       dpctl/mod-flow [--clear] [--may-create] [-s | --statistics] [dp] flow
       actions
              Adds  or  modifies a flow in dp's flow table that, when a packet
              matching flow arrives, causes actions to be executed.

              The add-flow command succeeds only if flow does not already  ex‐
              ist  in  dp.   Contrariwise,  mod-flow without --may-create only
              modifies the actions for an existing flow.   With  --may-create,
              mod-flow will add a new flow or modify an existing one.

              If  -s  or  --statistics  is specified, then mod-flow prints the
              modified flow's statistics.  A flow's statistics are the  number
              of  packets  and  bytes  that  have passed through the flow, the
              elapsed time since the flow last processed a packet  (if  ever),
              and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP flags processed through
              the flow.

              With  --clear,  mod-flow  zeros  out the flow's statistics.  The
              statistics printed if -s or --statistics is also  specified  are
              those from just before clearing the statistics.

              NOTE:  flow  and  actions  do  not  match  the  syntax used with
              ovs-ofctl(8)'s add-flow command.

              Usage Examples

              Forward ARP between ports 1 and 2 on datapath myDP:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x0806),arp()" 1

              Forward all IPv4 traffic between two addresses on ports 1 and 2:

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(1),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.4,dst=172.31.110.5)" 2

                     ovs-dpctl add-flow myDP \
                       "in_port(2),eth(),eth_type(0x800),\
                        ipv4(src=172.31.110.5,dst=172.31.110.4)" 1

       dpctl/add-flows [dp] file
       dpctl/mod-flows [dp] file
       dpctl/del-flows [dp] file
              Reads flow entries from file (or stdin if file is -)  and  adds,
              modifies,  or  deletes  each  entry  to the datapath.  Each flow
              specification (e.g., each line in file) may start with add, mod‐
              ify, or delete keyword to specify whether a flow is to be added,
              modified, or deleted. A flow specification without one of  these
              keywords is treated based on the used command.  All flow modifi‐
              cations  are  executed  as  individual transactions in the order
              specified.

       dpctl/del-flow [-s | --statistics] [dp] flow
              Deletes the flow from dp's flow table that matches flow.  If  -s
              or  --statistics  is specified, then del-flow prints the deleted
              flow's statistics.

       dpctl/get-flow [dp] ufid:ufid [-m | --more] [--names | --no-names]
              Fetches the flow from dp's flow  table  with  unique  identifier
              ufid.   ufid  must  be  specified  as a string of 32 hexadecimal
              characters.

       dpctl/del-flows [dp]
              Deletes all flow entries from datapath dp's flow table.

   DATAPATH FLOW CACHE COMMANDS
       The following commands are useful for  debugging  and  configuring  the
       datapath flow cache settings.

       dpctl/cache-get-size [dp]
              Prints the current cache sizes to the console.

       dpctl/cache-set-size dp cache size
              Set  the  dp's specific cache to the given size.  The cache name
              can be found by using the cache-get-size command.

   CONNECTION TRACKING TABLE COMMANDS
       The following commands are useful for  debugging  and  configuring  the
       connection tracking table in the datapath.

       The  dp argument to each of these commands is optional when exactly one
       datapath exists, in which case that datapath is the default.  When mul‐
       tiple datapaths exist, then a datapath name is required.

       N.B.(Linux specific): the system datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel  mod‐
       ule  Open  vSwitch  datapaths) share a single connection tracking table
       (which is also used by other kernel subsystems, such as iptables, nfta‐
       bles and the regular host stack).  Therefore, the following commands do
       not apply specifically to one datapath.

       dpctl/ipf-set-enabled [dp] v4|v6
       dpctl/ipf-set-disabled [dp] v4|v6
              Enables or disables IP fragmentation handling for the  userspace
              connection  tracker.   Either  v4 or v6 must be specified.  Both
              IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly are enabled by default.   Only
              supported for the userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ipf-set-min-frag [dp] v4|v6 minfrag
              Sets  the minimum fragment size (L3 header and data) for non-fi‐
              nal fragments to minfrag.  Either v4 or v6  must  be  specified.
              For  enhanced  DOS  security,  higher minimum fragment sizes can
              usually be used.  The default IPv4 value is 1200 and the clamped
              minimum is 400.  The default IPv6 value is 1280, with a  clamped
              minimum  of  400, for testing flexibility.  The maximum fragment
              size is not clamped, however, setting this value too high  might
              result  in  valid  fragments  being dropped.  Only supported for
              userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ipf-set-max-nfrags [dp] maxfrags
              Sets the maximum number of fragments tracked  by  the  userspace
              datapath  connection  tracker to maxfrags.  The default value is
              1000 and the clamped maximum is 5000.  Note that packet  buffers
              can  be held by the fragmentation module while fragments are in‐
              complete, but will timeout after 15 seconds.  Memory pool sizing
              should be set accordingly when fragmentation is  enabled.   Only
              supported for userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ipf-get-status [dp] [-m | --more]
              Gets the configuration settings and fragment counters associated
              with  the  fragmentation handling of the userspace datapath con‐
              nection tracker.  With -m or --more, also dumps the IP  fragment
              lists.  Only supported for userspace datapath.

       dpctl/dump-conntrack [-m | --more] [-s | --statistics] [dp] [zone=zone]
              Prints  to the console all the connection entries in the tracker
              used by dp.  If zone=zone is specified, only shows  the  connec‐
              tions  in  zone.   With --more, some implementation specific de‐
              tails are included. With --statistics  timeouts  and  timestamps
              are added to the output.

       dpctl/dump-conntrack-exp [dp] [zone=zone]
              Prints to the console all the expectation entries in the tracker
              used  by dp.  If zone=zone is specified, only shows the expecta‐
              tions in zone. Only supported for userspace datapath.

       dpctl/flush-conntrack [dp] [zone=zone] [ct-origin-tuple [ct-reply-tu‐
       ple]]
              Flushes the connection entries in the tracker used by  dp  based
              on  zone  and connection tracking tuple ct-origin-tuple.  If ct-
              tuple is not provided, flushes all the connection  entries.   If
              zone=zone is specified, only flushes the connections in zone.

              If ct-[orig|reply]-tuple is provided, flushes the connection en‐
              try  specified  by  ct-[orig|reply]-tuple in zone.  The zone de‐
              faults to 0 if it is not  provided.   The  userspace  connection
              tracker  requires flushing with the original pre-NATed tuple and
              a warning log will be otherwise generated.   The  tuple  can  be
              partial and will remove all connections that are matching on the
              specified fields.  In order to specify only ct-reply-tuple, pro‐
              vide empty string as ct-origin-tuple.

              Note:  Currently  there is a limitation for matching on ICMP, in
              order to partially match on  ICMP  parameters  the  ct-[orig|re‐
              ply]-tuple has to include either source or destination IP.

              An example of an IPv4 ICMP ct-[orig|reply]-tuple:

              "ct_nw_src=10.1.1.1,ct_nw_dst=10.1.1.2,ct_nw_proto=1,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0,icmp_id=10"

              An example of an IPv6 TCP ct-[orig|reply]-tuple:

              "ct_ipv6_src=fc00::1,ct_ipv6_dst=fc00::2,ct_nw_proto=6,ct_tp_src=1,ct_tp_dst=2"

       dpctl/ct-stats-show [dp] [zone=zone] [-m | --more]
              Displays  the  number of connections grouped by protocol used by
              dp.  If zone=zone is specified, numbers refer to the connections
              in zone.  With --more, groups by connection state for each  pro‐
              tocol.

       dpctl/ct-bkts [dp] [gt=threshold]
              For  each  conntrack  bucket, displays the number of connections
              used by dp.  If gt=threshold is specified,  bucket  numbers  are
              displayed  when the number of connections in a bucket is greater
              than threshold.

       dpctl/ct-set-maxconns [dp] maxconns
              Sets the maximum limit of connection tracker entries to maxconns
              on dp.  This can be used to reduce the processing  load  on  the
              system  due to connection tracking or simply limiting connection
              tracking.  If the number of connections is already over the  new
              maximum  limit  request  then  the new maximum limit will be en‐
              forced when the number of connections decreases to  that  limit,
              which normally happens due to connection expiry.  Only supported
              for userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ct-get-maxconns [dp]
              Prints  the  maximum  limit of connection tracker entries on dp.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ct-get-nconns [dp]
              Prints the current number of connection tracker entries  on  dp.
              Only supported for userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ct-enable-tcp-seq-chk [dp]
       dpctl/ct-disable-tcp-seq-chk [dp]
              Enables  or  disables  TCP  sequence checking.  When set to dis‐
              abled, all sequence number verification is  disabled,  including
              for  TCP  resets.  This is similar, but not the same as 'be_lib‐
              eral' mode, as in Netfilter.  Disabling sequence number  verifi‐
              cation  is not an optimization in itself, but is needed for some
              hardware offload support which might offer some performance  ad‐
              vantage.  Sequence  number checking is enabled by default to en‐
              force better security and should only be  disabled  if  required
              for  hardware  offload  support.  This command is only supported
              for the userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ct-get-tcp-seq-chk [dp]
              Prints whether TCP sequence checking is enabled or  disabled  on
              dp.  Only supported for the userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ct-set-sweep-interval [dp] ms
              Sets  the sweep interval. Only supported for the userspace data‐
              path.

       dpctl/ct-get-sweep-interval [dp]
              Prints the current sweep interval in ms. Only supported for  the
              userspace datapath.

       dpctl/ct-set-limits [dp] [default=default_limit]
       [zone=zone,limit=limit]...
              Sets  the  maximum allowed number of connections in a connection
              tracking zone.  A specific zone may be set to limit, and  multi‐
              ple  zones  may  be specified with a comma-separated list.  If a
              per-zone limit for a particular zone is  not  specified  in  the
              datapath,  it defaults to the default per-zone limit.  A default
              zone may be specified with the  default=default_limit  argument.
              Initially,  the  default per-zone limit is unlimited.  An unlim‐
              ited number of entries may be set with 0 limit.

       dpctl/ct-del-limits [dp] zone=zone[,zone]...
              Deletes the connection tracking limit for zone.  Multiple  zones
              may be specified with a comma-separated list.

       dpctl/ct-get-limits [dp] [zone=zone[,zone]...]
              Retrieves  the maximum allowed number of connections and current
              counts per-zone.  If zone is given, only the  specified  zone(s)
              are printed.  If no zones are specified, all the zone limits and
              counts  are  provided.   The command always displays the default
              zone limit.

   DPDK COMMANDS
       These commands manage DPDK components.

       dpdk/lcore-list
              Lists  the  DPDK  lcores   and   their   cpu   affinity.    When
              RTE_MAX_LCORE  lcores are registered, some OVS PMD threads won't
              appear.

       dpdk/log-list
              Lists all DPDK components that emit logs and their logging  lev‐
              els.

       dpdk/log-set [spec]
              Sets  DPDK  components logging level. Without any spec, sets the
              logging level for all DPDK components to debug. Otherwise,  spec
              is  a  list of words separated by spaces: a word can be either a
              logging level (emergency, alert, critical, error,  warning,  no‐
              tice,  info or debug) or a pattern matching DPDK components (see
              dpdk/log-list command on ovs-appctl(8))  separated  by  a  colon
              from the logging level to apply.

       dpdk/get-malloc-stats
              Prints the heap information statistics about DPDK malloc.

   DPIF-NETDEV COMMANDS
       These  commands are used to expose internal information (mostly statis‐
       tics) about the "dpif-netdev" userspace datapath. If there is only  one
       datapath  (as  is often the case, unless dpctl/ commands are used), the
       dp argument can be omitted. By default the commands  present  data  for
       all  pmd  threads in the datapath. By specifying the "-pmd Core" option
       one can filter the output for a single pmd in the datapath.

       dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show [-pmd core] [dp]
              Shows performance statistics for one or all pmd threads  of  the
              datapath dp. The special thread "main" sums up the statistics of
              every non pmd thread.

              The  sum  of "phwol hits", "simple match hits", "emc hits", "smc
              hits", "megaflow hits"  and  "miss"  is  the  number  of  packet
              lookups  performed  by  the datapath. Beware that a recirculated
              packet experiences one additional lookup per  recirculation,  so
              there  may  be  more lookups than forwarded packets in the data‐
              path.

              The MFEX Opt hits  displays  the  number  of  packets  that  are
              processed by the optimized miniflow extract implementations.

              Cycles  are  counted  using  the TSC or similar facilities (when
              available on the platform). The duration of one cycle depends on
              the processing platform.

              "idle cycles" refers to cycles spent in PMD iterations not  for‐
              warding  any  any  packets. "processing cycles" refers to cycles
              spent in PMD iterations forwarding at least one packet,  includ‐
              ing the cost for polling, processing and transmitting said pack‐
              ets.

              To reset these counters use dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear.

       dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear [dp]
              Resets  to  zero the per pmd thread performance numbers shown by
              the  dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show  and   dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-show
              commands.  It will NOT reset datapath or bridge statistics, only
              the values shown by the above commands.

       dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-show [-nh] [-it iter_len] [-ms ms_len] [-pmd core]
       [dp]
              Shows  detailed  performance metrics for one or all pmds threads
              of the user space datapath.

              The collection of detailed statistics can be controlled by a new
              configuration parameter "other_config:pmd-perf-metrics". By  de‐
              fault it is disabled. The run-time overhead, when enabled, is in
              the order of 1%.

              This raw recorded data is used threefold:


              1.     In histograms for each of the following metrics:
                     —      cycles/iteration (logarithmic)
                     —      packets/iteration (logarithmic)

                     —      cycles/upcall  (logarithmic)  The  histograms bins
                            are divided linear or logarithmic.
              2.     A cyclic history of the above metrics for 1024 iterations
              3.     A cyclic history of the  cummulative/average  values  per
                     millisecond wall clock for the last 1024 milliseconds:

                     —      upcalls
                     —      avg. cycles/upcall

              The command options are:

              -nh    Suppress the histograms

              -it iter_len
                     Display the last iter_len iteration stats

              -ms ms_len

              packet  lookups  as  reported  by the dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show
              command.

              To reset the counters and start a new measurement use  dpif-net‐
              dev/pmd-stats-clear.

       dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-log-set on|off [-b before] [-a after] [-e|-ne]
       [-us usec] [-q qlen]
              The  userspace  "netdev"  datapath  is able to supervise the PMD
              performance metrics and detect iterations with  suspicious  sta‐
              tistics according to the following criteria:

              —      The  iteration  lasts  longer than usec microseconds (de‐
                     fault 250).  This can be used to capture events  where  a
                     PMD  is  blocked or interrupted for such a period of time
                     that there is a risk for dropped packets on any of its Rx
                     queues.

              —      The max vhost qlen  exceeds  a  threshold  qlen  (default
                     128). This can be used to infer virtio queue overruns and
                     dropped packets inside a VM, which are not visible in OVS
                     otherwise.

              Such suspicious iterations can be logged together with their it‐
              eration  statistics in the ovs-vswitchd.log to be able to corre‐
              late them to packet drop or other events outside OVS.

              The above command enables (on) or disables (off) supervision and
              logging at run-time and can be used to adjust the above  thresh‐
              olds for detecting suspicious iterations. By default supervision
              and logging is disabled.

              The command options are:

              -b before
                     The  number of iterations before the suspicious iteration
                     to be logged (default 5).

              -a after
                     The number of iterations after the  suspicious  iteration
                     to be logged (default 5).

              -e     Extend  logging  interval if another suspicious iteration
                     is detected before logging occurs.

              -ne    Do not extend logging interval if another suspicious  it‐
                     eration is detected before logging occurs (default).

              -q qlen
                     Suspicious  vhost  queue  fill  level threshold. Increase
                     this to 512 if the Qemu supports 1024 virtio queue length
                     (default 128).

              -us usec
                     Change the duration threshold for a suspicious  iteration
                     (default 250 us).

       Note:  Logging  of suspicious iterations itself consumes a considerable
       amount of processing cycles of a PMD which may be visible in the itera‐
       tion history.  In the worst case this can lead OVS  to  detect  another
       suspicious iteration caused by logging.

       If  more  than  100  iterations around a suspicious iteration have been
       logged once, OVS falls back to the safe default values (-b 5 -a 5  -ne)
       to  avoid  that  logging  itself continuously causes logging of further
       suspicious iterations.

       dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-show [-pmd core] [dp]
              For one or all pmd threads of the datapath dp show the  list  of
              queue-ids with port names, which this thread polls.

       dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-rebalance [dp]
              Reassigns rxqs to pmds in the datapath dp based on their current
              usage.

       dpif-netdev/bond-show [dp]
              When "other_config:lb-output-action" is set to "true", the user‐
              space  datapath handles the load balancing of bonds directly in‐
              stead of depending on flow recirculation  (only  in  balance-tcp
              mode).

              When this is the case, the above command prints the load-balanc‐
              ing  information  of the bonds configured in datapath dp showing
              the interface associated with each bucket (hash).

       dpif-netdev/subtable-lookup-prio-get
              Lists the DPCLS implementations or  lookup  functions  that  are
              available as well as their priorities.

       dpif-netdev/subtable-lookup-prio-set lookup_function prio
              Sets the priority of a lookup function by name, lookup_function,
              and  priority,  prio,  which should be a positive integer value.
              The highest priority lookup function is used for classification.

              The number of affected dpcls ports and subtables is returned.

       dpif-netdev/dpif-impl-get
              Lists the DPIF implementations that are available.

       dpif-netdev/dpif-impl-set dpif_impl
              Sets the DPIF to be used to dpif_impl. By default  "dpif_scalar"
              is used.

       dpif-netdev/miniflow-parser-get
              Lists the miniflow extract implementations that are available.

       dpif-netdev/miniflow-parser-set [-pmd core] miniflow_impl [study_cnt]
              Sets  the  miniflow extract to miniflow_impl for a specified PMD
              or all PMDs in the case where no value is specified.  By default
              "scalar" is used.  study_cnt defaults to 128 and  indicates  the
              number  of packets that the "study" miniflow implementation must
              parse before choosing an optimal implementation.

   DPIF-NETLINK COMMANDS
       These commands are used to expose internal information  of  the  "dpif-
       netlink" kernel space datapath.

       dpif-netlink/dispatch-mode
              Displays the "dispatch-mode" for all datapaths.

   NETDEV-DPDK COMMANDS
       These commands manage DPDK related ports (type=dpdk*).

       netdev-dpdk/set-admin-state [interface] up | down
              Change the admin state for DPDK interface to up or down.  If in‐
              terface is not specified, then it applies to all DPDK ports.

       netdev-dpdk/detach pci-address
              Detaches  device with corresponding pci-address from DPDK.  This
              command can be used to detach device if it wasn't detached auto‐
              matically after port deletion. Refer to  the  documentation  for
              details and instructions.

       netdev-dpdk/get-mempool-info [interface]
              Prints  the debug information about memory pool used by DPDK in‐
              terface.  If called without arguments, information  of  all  the
              available  mempools will be printed. For additional mempool sta‐
              tistics enable  CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MEMPOOL_DEBUG  while  building
              DPDK.

   ODP-EXECUTE COMMANDS
       These commands manage the "odp-execute" component.


       odp-execute/action-impl-show
              Lists  the  actions implementations that are available and high‐
              lights the currently enabled one.

       odp-execute/action-impl-set action_impl
              Sets the action implementation to any available  implementation.
              By default "scalar" is used.

   DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS
       These  commands  query  and  modify datapaths.  They are are similar to
       ovs-dpctl(8) commands.  dpif/show has the additional functionality, be‐
       yond dpctl/show of printing OpenFlow port numbers.  The other  commands
       are redundant and will be removed in a future release.

       dpif/dump-dps
              Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate line.

       dpif/show
              Prints  a  summary of configured datapaths, including statistics
              and a list of connected ports.  The  port  information  includes
              the  OpenFlow  port  number, datapath port number, and the type.
              (The local port is identified as OpenFlow port 65534.)

       dpif/dump-flows [-m] dp
              Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath dp's flow ta‐
              ble. Without -m, output omits match fields that a flow wildcards
              entirely; with -m output includes all wildcarded fields.

              This command is primarily useful  for  debugging  Open  vSwitch.
              The  flow  table  entries that it displays are not OpenFlow flow
              entries.  Instead, they are different and  considerably  simpler
              flows maintained by the datapath module.  If you wish to see the
              OpenFlow flow entries, use ovs-ofctl dump-flows.

       dpif/del-flows dp
              Deletes  all  flow entries from datapath dp's flow table and un‐
              derlying datapath implementation (e.g., kernel datapath module).

              This command is primarily useful for debugging Open vSwitch.  As
              discussed in dpif/dump-flows, these  entries  are  not  OpenFlow
              flow entries.

   OFPROTO COMMANDS
       These  commands  manage the core OpenFlow switch implementation (called
       ofproto).

       ofproto/list
              Lists the names of the running ofproto instances.  These are the
              names that may be used on ofproto/trace.

       ofproto/trace [options] [dpname] odp_flow [packet]
       ofproto/trace [options] bridge br_flow [packet]]
       ofproto/trace-packet-out [options] [dpname] odp_flow [packet] actions
       ofproto/trace-packet-out [options] bridge br_flow [packet] actions
              Traces the path of an imaginary packet through  switch  and  re‐
              ports  the  path  that  it  took.   The initial treatment of the
              packet varies based on the command:

              •      ofproto/trace looks the packet up in  the  OpenFlow  flow
                     table, as if the packet had arrived on an OpenFlow port.

              •      ofproto/trace-packet-out  applies  the specified OpenFlow
                     actions, as if the packet, flow,  and  actions  had  been
                     specified in an OpenFlow ``packet-out'' request.

              The  packet's headers (e.g. source and destination) and metadata
              (e.g. input port), together called its ``flow,'' are usually all
              that matter for the purpose of tracing a packet.  You can  spec‐
              ify the flow in the following ways:

              dpname odp_flow
                     odp_flow  is a flow in the form printed by ovs-dpctl(8)'s
                     dump-flows command.  If all of your bridges have the same
                     type, which is the common case, then you can omit dpname,
                     but if you have bridges of  different  types  (say,  both
                     ovs-netdev  and  ovs-system),  then you need to specify a
                     dpname to disambiguate.

              bridge br_flow
                     br_flow is a flow in the form similar to that accepted by
                     ovs-ofctl(8)'s add-flow command.  (This is not  an  Open‐
                     Flow  flow:  besides other differences, it never contains
                     wildcards.)  bridge names of  the  bridge  through  which
                     br_flow should be traced.

              These commands support the following options:

              --generate
                     Generate  a  packet from the flow (see below for more in‐
                     formation).

              --l7 payload
              --l7-len length
                     Accepted only with --generate (see below for more  infor‐
                     mation).

              --consistent
                     Accepted by ofproto-trace-packet-out only.  With this op‐
                     tion,  the  command rejects actions that are inconsistent
                     with the specified packet.  (An example of  an  inconsis‐
                     tency  is  attempting to strip the VLAN tag from a packet
                     that does not have a VLAN  tag.)   Open  vSwitch  ignores
                     most  forms  of inconsistency in OpenFlow 1.0 and rejects
                     inconsistencies in later versions of OpenFlow.   The  op‐
                     tion is necessary because the command does not ordinarily
                     imply  a  particular  OpenFlow version.  One exception is
                     that, when actions includes an action that only  OpenFlow
                     1.1  and later supports (such as push_vlan), --consistent
                     is automatically enabled.

              --ct-next flags
                     When the traced  flow  triggers  conntrack  actions,  of‐
                     proto/trace  will  automatically  trace the forked packet
                     processing pipeline with user specified  ct_state.   This
                     option  sets the ct_state flags that the conntrack module
                     will report. The flags must be a  comma-  or  space-sepa‐
                     rated list of the following connection tracking flags:

                     •      trk:  Include  to indicate connection tracking has
                            taken place.

                     •      new: Include to indicate a new flow.

                     •      est: Include to indicate an established flow.

                     •      rel: Include to indicate a related flow.

                     •      rpl: Include to indicate a reply flow.

                     •      inv: Include to indicate a connection entry  in  a
                            bad state.

                     •      dnat:  Include to indicate a packet whose destina‐
                            tion IP address has been changed.

                     •      snat: Include to indicate a packet whose source IP
                            address has been changed.

                     When --ct-next is unspecified, or when  there  are  fewer
                     --ct-next  options  than ct actions, the flags default to
                     trk,new.

              Most commonly, one specifies only a flow, using one of the forms
              above, but sometimes one might need to specify an actual  packet
              instead of just a flow:

              Side effects.
                     Some  actions have side effects.  For example, the normal
                     action can update the MAC learning table, and  the  learn
                     action  can  change  OpenFlow tables.  The trace commands
                     only perform side effects when a packet is specified.  If
                     you want side effects to take place, then you must supply
                     a packet.

                     (Output actions are obviously side effects too,  but  the
                     trace  commands  never execute them, even when one speci‐
                     fies a packet.)

              Incomplete information.
                     Most of the time, Open vSwitch can figure out  everything
                     about  the  path  of a packet using just the flow, but in
                     some special circumstances it needs to look at  parts  of
                     the  packet that are not included in the flow.  When this
                     is the case, and you do not supply a packet, then a trace
                     command will tell you it needs a packet.

              If you wish to include a packet as part of  a  trace  operation,
              there are two ways to do it:

              --generate
                     This  option,  added to one of the ways to specify a flow
                     already described, causes Open vSwitch to internally gen‐
                     erate a packet with the flow described and  then  to  use
                     that  packet.   If  your goal is to execute side effects,
                     then --generate is the easiest way to do it, but --gener‐
                     ate is not a good way to fill in incomplete  information,
                     because  it  generates packets based on only the flow in‐
                     formation, which means that the  packets  really  do  not
                     have any more information than the flow.

                     By  default,  for  protocols that allow arbitrary L7 pay‐
                     loads, the generated packet has 64 bytes of payload.  Use
                     --l7-len to change the payload length, or --l7 to specify
                     the exact contents of the payload.

              packet This form supplies an explicit packet as  a  sequence  of
                     hex digits.  An Ethernet frame is at least 14 bytes long,
                     so  there  must be at least 28 hex digits.  Obviously, it
                     is inconvenient to type in the hex digits by hand, so the
                     ovs-pcap(1) and ovs-tcpundump(1) utilities provide easier
                     ways.

                     With this form, packet  headers  are  extracted  directly
                     from  packet,  so  the odp_flow or br_flow should specify
                     only metadata. The metadata can be:

                     skb_priority
                            Packet QoS priority.

                     pkt_mark
                            Mark of the packet.

                     ct_state
                            Connection state of the packet.

                     ct_zone
                            Connection tracking zone for packet.

                     ct_mark
                            Connection mark of the packet.

                     ct_label
                            Connection label of the packet.

                     tun_id The tunnel ID on which the packet arrived.

                     in_port
                            The port on which the packet arrived.

              The in_port value is kernel datapath port number for  the  first
              format  and OpenFlow port number for the second format. The num‐
              bering of these two types of port usually differs and  there  is
              no relationship.

       Usage examples:

           Trace an unicast ICMP echo request on ingress port 1 to destination
           MAC 00:00:5E:00:53:01
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,icmp,icmp_type=8,\
               dl_dst=00:00:5E:00:53:01

           Trace  an  unicast ICMP echo reply on ingress port 1 to destination
           MAC 00:00:5E:00:53:01
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,icmp,icmp_type=0,\
               dl_dst=00:00:5E:00:53:01

           Trace an ARP request on ingress port 1
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,arp,arp_op=1

           Trace an ARP reply on ingress port 1
               ofproto/trace br in_port=1,arp,arp_op=2

   VLOG COMMANDS
       These commands manage ovs-vswitchd's logging settings.

       vlog/set [spec]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any spec, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and destination to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list
              of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              •      A valid module name, as displayed by the  vlog/list  com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              •      syslog,  console,  or file, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.

                     On  Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  --syslog-target  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              •      off,  emer,  err,  warn, info, or dbg, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  off filters out all  messages.   See  ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for file, logging to a file
              will not take place unless ovs-vswitchd  was  invoked  with  the
              --log-file option.

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       vlog/set PATTERN:destination:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  destination  to pattern.  Refer to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       vlog/list
              Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.

       vlog/list-pattern
              Lists logging patterns used for each destination.

       vlog/close
              Causes ovs-vswitchd to close its log file, if it is open.   (Use
              vlog/reopen to reopen it later.)

       vlog/reopen
              Causes  ovs-vswitchd  to  close its log file, if it is open, and
              then reopen it.  (This is useful after rotating  log  files,  to
              cause a new log file to be used.)

              This  has  no  effect  unless  ovs-vswitchd was invoked with the
              --log-file option.

       vlog/disable-rate-limit [module]...
       vlog/enable-rate-limit [module]...
              By default, ovs-vswitchd limits the rate at which  certain  mes‐
              sages  can  be  logged.   When  a message would appear more fre‐
              quently than the limit,  it  is  suppressed.   This  saves  disk
              space,  makes  logs easier to read, and speeds up execution, but
              occasionally troubleshooting requires more  detail.   Therefore,
              vlog/disable-rate-limit allows rate limits to be disabled at the
              level  of  an individual log module.  Specify one or more module
              names, as displayed by the vlog/list command.  Specifying either
              no module names at all or the keyword any disables  rate  limits
              for every log module.

              The  vlog/enable-rate-limit command, whose syntax is the same as
              vlog/disable-rate-limit, can be used to re-enable a  rate  limit
              that was previously disabled.

   MEMORY COMMANDS
       These commands report memory usage.

       memory/show
              Displays  some  basic statistics about ovs-vswitchd's memory us‐
              age.  ovs-vswitchd also logs this information soon after startup
              and periodically as its memory consumption grows.

   COVERAGE COMMANDS
       These commands manage ovs-vswitchd's ``coverage counters,'' which count
       the number of times particular events occur during a daemon's  runtime.
       In addition to these commands, ovs-vswitchd automatically logs coverage
       counter  values,  at INFO level, when it detects that the daemon's main
       loop takes unusually long to run.

       Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and debug‐
       ging.

       coverage/show
              Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds,
              the last minute and the last hour, and the total counts  of  all
              of the coverage counters.

       coverage/read-counter counter
              Displays the total count for the given coverage counter.

   OPENVSWITCH TUNNELING COMMANDS
       These commands query and modify OVS tunnel components.

       ovs/route/add ip/plen output_bridge [gw] [pkt_mark=mark] [src=src_ip]
              Adds  ip/plen  route  to  vswitchd  routing table. output_bridge
              needs to be OVS bridge name.  This  command  is  useful  if  OVS
              cached routes does not look right.

       ovs/route/show
              Print  all  routes  in  OVS  routing table, This includes routes
              cached from system routing table and user configured routes.

       ovs/route/del ip/plen [pkt_mark=mark]
              Delete ip/plen route from OVS routing table.

       tnl/neigh/show

       tnl/arp/show
              OVS builds ARP cache by  snooping  are  messages.  This  command
              shows ARP cache table.

       tnl/neigh/set bridge ip mac

       tnl/arp/set bridge ip mac
              Adds  or  modifies  an  ARP cache entry in bridge, mapping ip to
              mac.

       tnl/neigh/flush

       tnl/arp/flush
              Flush ARP table.

       tnl/neigh/aging [seconds]

       tnl/arp/aging [seconds]
              Changes the aging time. The accepted values of seconds  are  be‐
              tween  1  and 3600. The new entries will get the value as speci‐
              fied in seconds. For the existing entries, the aging time is up‐
              dated only if the current expiration is greater than seconds.

              If used without arguments, it prints the current aging value.

       tnl/egress_port_range [num1] [num2]
              Set range for UDP source port used for UDP  based  Tunnels.  For
              example  VxLAN.  If  case  of zero arguments this command prints
              current range in use.

OPENFLOW IMPLEMENTATION
       This section documents aspects of OpenFlow for which the OpenFlow spec‐
       ification requires documentation.

   Packet buffering.
       The OpenFlow specification, version 1.2, says:

              Switches  that  implement  buffering  are  expected  to  expose,
              through  documentation,  both the amount of available buffering,
              and the length of time before buffers may be reused.

       Open vSwitch does not maintains any packet buffers.

   Bundle lifetime
       The OpenFlow specification, version 1.4, says:

              If the  switch  does  not  receive  any  OFPT_BUNDLE_CONTROL  or
              OFPT_BUNDLE_ADD_MESSAGE  message  for  an opened bundle_id for a
              switch defined time greater than 1s,  it  may  send  an  ofp_er‐
              ror_msg  with  OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED type and OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code.
              If the switch does not receive any new message in a bundle apart
              from echo request and replies for a switch defined time  greater
              than  1s,  it may send an ofp_error_msg with OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED
              type and OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code.

       Open vSwitch implements default idle bundle  lifetime  of  10  seconds.
       (This  is  configurable  via  other-config:bundle-idle-timeout  in  the
       Open_vSwitch table. See ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for details.)

LIMITS
       We believe these limits to be accurate as of this writing.  These  lim‐
       its assume the use of the Linux kernel datapath.

       •      ovs-vswitchd  started  through  ovs-ctl(8)  provides  a limit of
              65535 file descriptors.  The limits on the number of bridges and
              ports is decided by the availability of file descriptors.   With
              the  Linux kernel datapath, creation of a single bridge consumes
              three file descriptors and each  port  consumes  one  additional
              file  descriptor.   Other  platforms  may have different limita‐
              tions.

       •      8,192 MAC learning entries per bridge,  by  default.   (This  is
              configurable  via  other-config:mac-table-size in the Bridge ta‐
              ble.  See ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for details.)

       •      Kernel flows are limited only by memory available to the kernel.
              Performance will  degrade  beyond  1,048,576  kernel  flows  per
              bridge  with  a 32-bit kernel, beyond 262,144 with a 64-bit ker‐
              nel.  (ovs-vswitchd should never install anywhere near that many
              flows.)

       •      OpenFlow flows are limited only by  available  memory.   Perfor‐
              mance is linear in the number of unique wildcard patterns.  That
              is, an OpenFlow table that contains many flows that all match on
              the  same fields in the same way has a constant-time lookup, but
              a table that contains many flows that match on different  fields
              requires lookup time linear in the number of flows.

       •      255  ports per bridge participating in 802.1D Spanning Tree Pro‐
              tocol.

       •      32 mirrors per bridge.

       •      15 bytes for the name of a port, for ports  implemented  in  the
              Linux  kernel.   Ports  implemented  in userspace, such as patch
              ports, do not have an  arbitrary  length  limitation.   OpenFlow
              also limit port names to 15 bytes.
