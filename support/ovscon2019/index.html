<h3 id="0.1L"><a href="#s0.1L">Programming memory safe OVS in Rust</a> (William Tu and Yi-Hung Wei, VMware)</h3>

<p>Programming in unsafe languages like C is easily in jeopardy of memory
issues such as buffer and stack overflows, dangling pointers, accesses
of uninitialized or deallocated memory, and memory leakage. These
memory safety issues can be exploited and leads to serve security
vulnerability, and unpredictable behavior. For example, memory bugs in
OVS’s packet processing, especially in parsing packet content and
building the flow key, are prone to attacks, since it is always be
executed for every packet. Thus, an attacker can craft packets to
exploit the memory issue and launch a buffer overflow attack, such as
[1]. Other than the security vulnerability, a small memory leakage in
the packet processing path can quickly accumulated and leads to
ovs-vswitchd crash when it runs out of memory, such as [2]. Bugs like
these two are hard to detect and common in software written in C
language.</p>

<p>Rust is a system programming language that provides memory safety
without runtime overhead. Rust gives users fine control over the use
of memory, but keeps track of the lifetime and ownership of each
memory region. This model leads to less likely of memory leak,
dangling pointers, or memory corruption issues. In this talk, we are
working on replacing one of the memory safety critical parts in OVS
from C code to Rust, starting by flow_extract(). We will share our
experiences and lessons learned in this process.</p>

<p>I will talk about what is the DPDK Community Lab and the type of
testing we do with OVS. This will include briefly talking about how
some basic testing is performed and how we run performance testing
using ovs_perf with hardware from different vendors.</p>

<h3 id="0.3F"><a href="#s0.3F">The Discrepancy of the Megaflow Cache in OVS, Part II</a> (Levente Csikor, National University of Singapore)</h3>

<p>Open vSwitch (OVS) has stood the test of time in the field of OpenFlow
(OF) software switching and its brand has been spreading virally in an
unprecedented way; it is present in almost all (open source)
networking environment starting from simple (Linux-based) operating
systems through heavily virtualized Cloud Management Systems (e.g.,
OpenStack) to serverless environments (e.g., Kubernetes).</p>

<p>Due to Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and the ever increasing
trend of offloading (business-critical) workloads to the public
cloud, significant parts of the networking ecosystem (e.g., packet
classification) have inherently become offloaded to virtualized packet
processors (i.e., Open vSwitch).  High traffic demands and
latency-critical applications, on the other hand, require the packet
classifier to be highly efficient and dependable. To support this,
several years (and version numbers) ago, OVS has introduced a layered
cache architecture in its fast past to achieve a reliable and blazing
packet processing [1].</p>

<p>In our previous talk [2, 3], we have demonstrated that the packet
classification algorithm in this caching architecture, namely the
Tuple Space Search (TSS) scheme in the second level MegaFlow Cache
(MFC), has an algorithmic deficiency that can be abused by an attacker
to push this generally high performing packet classifier to its corner
case. Particularly, we have shown that for each simple ACL (e.g.,
allow destination port 80 and drop everything else[*]) there is a
specially crafted packet sequence that when subjected to this ACL in
lower than 1 Mbps traffic rate, can virtually bring down OVS causing a
complete denial-of-service for each workload accessible through that
OVS instance, i.e., in a cloud environment, all services that happened
to be scheduled to the same hypervisor become inaccessible. Note that
such a service outage can cause millions of dollars for enterprises
[4].</p>

<p>  [*] According to the cloud security best practice’s Whitelist
      default deny policy</p>

<p>Our previous study, however, has some limitations: (i) an attacker
exploiting this discrepancy has to be aware of the target ACL
installed in the flow table and (ii) beside some immediate yet
impractical remedies (e.g., switching MFC off, relying on a different
hypervisor switch implementation instead), it is lacking of any
countermeasure. Moreover, to easily support (i), the threat model was
limited to cloud environments, where an attacker has to lease her own
resources, define her own (malicious) ACLs and send a specially
crafted packet sequence towards her own service resulting in a denial-
of-service attack against all co-located workloads only.</p>

<p>In this work, we have carried on with the main idea of [2] and we
study whether an attacker can get rid of the above mentioned
limitations (i.e., attacking arbitrary victims), and how its impact
(e.g., level of degradation, required packet rate) would change (if it
is possible at all, see [5] for more details). Furthermore, we have
developed a promising mitigation technique and we are reaching out to
the OVS community to share and discuss the obstacles still present on
the way to completely resolve this issue.</p>

<p>During our talk, first, we briefly cover the main properties of the
caching architecture and the main outcomes of our previous study (670
kbps of attack traffic from a single traffic source can easily degrade
a single OVS instance from its full capacity of 10 Gbps to 2 Mbps)
that we term here as co-located case.</p>

<p>Then, we show that when an adversary has no such access to her target
(e.g., neither leased resources in the cloud nor knowledge of the
installed ACLs), she can still achieve a significant degradation of
88% from the maximum capacity with low attack traffic volume (6.72M
bps). One interesting aspect of this latter approach (hereafter,
termed as general case) is that it does not demonstrate any specific
patterns of its attack traffic: it only requires completely random
packet header fields and arbitrary message contents, along with
arbitrary packet arrival times making the overall identification hard
as it is not straightforward to define a specific signature of the
attack traffic.</p>

<p>As a mitigation technique, we present a cache management scheme, which
we call MFC Guard (MFCg), that dynamically monitors the number of
entries in the MFC and removes less important ones to reduce the
performance overhead of the TSS algorithm. It is worth noting that we
have observed negligible impact on the overall packet processing
performance during the monitoring process itself (i.e., executing
ovs-dpctl dump-flows in, say, each second).</p>

<p>We show that MFCg can limit and even completely avoid the performance
degradation for the packets that are eventually allowed to the
system. However, nothing comes without a sacrifice: since removing a
cache entry from the MFC results in the corresponding malicious flow’s
packets to be processed (again) by the slow path (i.e., ovs-vswitchd),
this guaranteed performance of the allowed packets imposes some extra
overhead. Contrary to the fact those packets should be cached again in
the MFC, we have observed an unexpected behavior: such packets will
always be processed by the slow path henceforth. Even if the overhead
becomes constant with this conduct, as long as the attack rate is less
than 1, 000 pps (&lt; 1 Mbps) the slow path only consumes 15% of the CPU;
recall, this packet rate is enough to bring down OVS in case of
co-location [2]). However, when the packet rate is 10, 000 pps (&lt; 7
Mbps), the CPU load jumps up to ≈ 80% (this rate would be enough to
degrade the full capacity to 10% in the general case). We can conclude
that our current MFCg implementation can efficiently mitigate both
attacks as long as the attacking rate is low, however further
optimization can be carried out regarding the behavior of OVS. On the
other hand, if the attack rate is much above 10, 000 pps, such an
attack can be considered as a volumetric attack, for which there are
multiple solutions to efficiently detect and mitigate (e.g., excess
amount of packets and over-provisioning, scrubbing techniques).</p>

<h3 id="0.4F"><a href="#s0.4F">A Kubernetes Networking Implementation Using Open vSwitch</a> (Jianjun Shen, VMware)</h3>

<p>This talk introduces a Kubernetes networking implementation built on
top of Open vSwitch. The solution is designed to be Kubernetes centric
– it supports Kubernetes networking functionalities (Pod network,
NetworkPolicy, ClusterIP and NodePort Service) and supports only
Kubernetes, it is optimized for Kuberenetes networking, it tries to be
Kubernetes native and leverages Kubernetes as much as possible. The
presented solution uses OVS to implement all Pod networking
functionalities in a Kubernetes Node, and targets for a high
performance Kubernetes NetworkPolicy implementation with optimizations
in control plane and OVS flows. With the great portability of OVS, the
solution could support any compute platforms Kubernetes runs – virtual
machines on any hypervisor and public cloud, baremetal container
hosts, Windows hosts. The project will be open source but it is still
at an early stage now and not available for use yet.</p>

<p>This talk also presents a few challenges we saw in implementing
Kubernetes networking, especially Kubernetes NetworkPolicy with
OVS. We like to get feedback from the audiences on the implementation,
and discuss how OVS can support Kubernetes network better and be the
best data plane choice for Kubernetes.</p>

<h3 id="0.5F"><a href="#s0.5F">OVS DPDK issues in Openstack and Kubernetes and Solutions</a> (Yi Yang, Inspur)</h3>

<p>Although OVS DPDK can be used to accelerate tenant networking, it also
has many limitations because it has to communicate from user space
with tap and veth device in kernel, this has huge side impacts on
networking performance, we found many issues in practice in Openstack
deployment and would like to share them to the community, this talk
will show all the known issues we found and propose some solutions to
them in order that the community can take them seriously and spend
some time in improving them.  This talk also will demonstrate the
issues.</p>

<h3 id="1.1L"><a href="#s1.1L">OVS-DPDK life of a packet</a> (Eelco Chaudron and Kevin Traynor, Red Hat)</h3>

<p>The PVP path is packets being received from physical interface (P),
transmitted and received to/from vhost interfaces (V), and finally
sent to a physical interface (P).</p>

<p>We will talk about what are the areas along that path where packet
drops may occur, what to look out for in statistics and some recent
patches to help with visibility.</p>

<h3 id="1.2L"><a href="#s1.2L">Utilizing DPDK Virtual Devices in OVS</a> (Lei A Yao and Wang Yinan, Intel)</h3>

<p>OVS start to support virtual DPDK poll mode driver (vdev PMD) from
release 2.7.  These network virtual devices can be used in different
scenario. For example, KNI, Virtio-user, TAP devices can re-direct the
packets from user-space back to kernel, recognized as exception path
capability which is useful for container network and control
path. af_packet, pcap, af_xdp are virtual devices which can expose
kernel packets to user space.</p>

<p>This talk will give one brief introduction for these DPDK network virtual
devices, including the performance comparation and several configuration
limitations during implementing these devices into OVS-DPDK.</p>

<h3 id="1.3F"><a href="#s1.3F">OVN-Kubernetes HW Offload - Is it even possible?</a> (Amnon Ilan and Eelco Chaudron, Red Hat)</h3>

<p>OVN-Kubernetes is gaining more popularity in Kubernetes based solutions
such as Openshift.</p>

<p>Kubernetes networking is heavily based on the Linux kernel, using many
software capabilities of Linux networking, and performing all
processing and forwarding operations in software.</p>

<p>As a result, the performance of Kubernetes networking is not allways close
to wire-speed performance, and the CPU resources of the nodes are highly
utilized, leaving less resources for the applications.</p>

<p>Can ovn-kubernetes networking operations be offloaded to the hardware?</p>

<p>As we start to explore this direction, the talk will not have any final
answers for the question above, but will rather try to identify what are
the basic network-related operations performed by ovn-kubernetes nodes,
while raising ideas, questions and problems involved in trying to offload
some of it to hardware.</p>

<h3 id="1.4F"><a href="#s1.4F">OVN for NFV workloads with Kubernetes</a> (Ritu Sood and Srinivasa Addepalli, Intel)</h3>

<p>There is tremendous interest in deploying NFV workloads from
Kubernetes in Edges as Edges can&#x27;t afford to have two resource
orchestrators - One for applications and another for VNFs/CNFs. NFV
workloads can be management plane workloads, control plane workloads
and user plane/data plane workloads. Data plane workloads normally
have multiple interfaces, multiple subnets, and multiple virtual
networks. Some data plane workloads require SR-IOV NIC support for
data interfaces and virtual NIC for other interfaces. NFV workloads
may require dynamic creation of virtual networks and dynamic
configuration of subnets. Some NFV&#x27;s also require provider network
support. There is also a requirement for route management across
virtual networks and external networks.</p>

<p>Ovn-kubernetes project (https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes) is
Kubernetes integration for OVN. To meet NFV requirements as listed
above some functionality beyond the functionality provided by
ovn-kubernetes is required.  To fill the functionality gaps a project
under OPNFV is started called ovn4nfvk8s Plugin
(https://github.com/opnfv/ovn4nfv-k8s-plugin). This project is filling
in the functionality gap by providing dynamic creation and deletion
for virtual networks and provider networks, adding multiple interfaces
to workloads either virtual network interface or provider network
interface and route management for these networks. This project works
with Multus to provide a CNI to attach multiple OVN interfaces into
workloads and supports CRD controllers for dynamic networks and

<p>Open vSwitch (OvS) is a widely deployed open source virtual switch
today.  OvS-DPDK uses Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to run entire
OvS in user space. OvS-DPDK significantly improves packet processing
and forwarding rate by eliminating the cost of interrupt processing
and user-kernel context switches. DPDK recently introduced rte_flow
API to provide a generic means to further improve flow classification
and action processing by accelerating them in hardware for specific
ingress or egress flows.</p>

<p>The current rte_flow API has several missing pieces including hardware
flow processing capabilities discovery, no mapping for some of the OvS
actions (e.g. Output-Port) onto rte_flow actions, gaps in mapping
OvS-DPDK control plane operations onto rte_flow operations, and OvS
actions that are not currently supported by OvS-DPDK when it uses
rte_flow. This talk will cover the challenges and gaps in OvS-DPDK
acceleration with rte_flow and propose solutions to address them.</p>

<h3 id="2.2L"><a href="#s2.2L">Partial offload optimization and performance on Intel Fortville NICs using rte_flow</a> (Irene Liew and Chenmin Sun, Intel)</h3>

<p>OVS in the kernel datapath had been enabled with hardware offload through TC
flower packet classifier in the kernel. In the userspace datapath (OVS-DPDK),
various development and optimization to improve/accelerate the packet
classification in the virtual switch have been the focus to achieve higher
switching capability in respond to the rapidly changing cloud and telco
networking. Partial offload or partial hardware offload pushes flow rules along
with unique marks to the network card.  OVS-DPDK uses rte_flow API to match
packets based on flow rule and mark them accordingly. The rules are programed
into Intel(r) Fortville NIC FDIR (flow director). Then OVS-DPDK virtual switch
would use each unique mark to find the specific flow rule and execute the
actions in software. With partial offload, OVS-DPDK does not need to parse all
the packets headers and goes through EMC.  OVS-DPDK leverages the network card
flow MARK action&#x27;s support in the hardware to skip some very costly CPU
operations in the host. However, the current insertion and deletion flow
operations using rte_flow API are very slow in the i40e DPDK driver, which
limits userspace datapath OVS benefiting from rte_flow hardware offload
feature. This presentation introduces the rte_flow driver optimization for i40e
driver in DPDK. The optimization includes implementation of rte_bitmap and
software pipeline to manage hardware resources and to avoid synchronization
wait time for the hardware. In addition, the consumed cycles are further
compressed via optimizing the dynamic memory allocation code. The performance
of the revised code is 20,000 times better than the original code. With the
latest optimization of i40e driver in DPDK, partial hardware offload can be
enabled in OVS-DPDK (userspace datapath) using Intel(r) Fortville NICs (XL710,
X710 and XVV710). With partial offload, virtual switching throughput increases
significantly with observation of 1.7x gain in Phy-Phy running with  2000 UDP
rules program in OVS up to 1 million flows. Less CPU cycles is being utilized
to classify the packets.</p>

<p>Open vSwitch is often deployed to provide network access to VMs in
cloud environments. The rich feature-set of OVS makes it attractive
for these deployments as it allows policy enforcement, encapsulation,
quality-of-service and a myriad of other features. However, the
features facilitated by a software-based switch come at a cost in
terms of performance and host CPU utilisation. Hardware offload seeks
to address those short-comings while preserving the richness of OVS.</p>

<p>This presentation will take a look at the evolution of kernel-based
offloads for OVS examining the offload model adopted by the upstream
kernel, features currently supported, and possible future developments
in this area.</p>

<p>True that 100GbE NIC is still far reality when it comes to
production-grade deployment. However, Vendors were quick to make
100BbE ethernet switches/NICs which are readily available today and In
fact, they have gone 1 notch up and more &amp; more features are being
integrated/elevated/developed to suit 100 gig infrastructure now.</p>

<p>Target to NextGen data center, OpenvSwitch is further accelerated
through Hardware offload where it leverages the functions to enable
split data plane between OpenvSwitch and SMART NIC(100 GbE) with help
of Embedded Switch functionalities.  However, From hardware stability
to software handling such humongous stress is challenging and the
maturity level of 10/40 GbE nic is still hard to achieve especially
when it comes to fine-tuning compute for performance.  We explored
this territory with OpenvSwitch(TC-HW-Offload) enabled on SMART NIC
(Mellanox ConnectX-5 Ex 100GbE) nic to measure its throughput and
latency numbers in offering when it plugged to Openstack
infrastructure/services.</p>

<p>We would like to showcase the following at this conference.</p>

<ul>
<li>The problems encountered while working on OVS-HW-Offload with
  SMART-NIC and resolution applied to those</li>

<li>Fine-tuning of the required parameters to achieve near line-rate
  throughput and latency</li>

<p>Until version 2.12 the multicast support in OVN was limited to
flooding traffic within the broadcast domain without allowing it to
cross network boundaries. In this presentation we describe the newly
added IP Multicast support in OVN. We talk about IGMP snooping in OVN
networks but also about IP multicast routing performed without the
need of a classic multicast routing protocol. We zoom in on the
implementation as this is one of the few OVN features where ovn-northd
dynamically installs logical flows based on IP multicast information
snooped by ovn-controllers.</p>

<p>We will present the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>OVN L2 multicast packet handling.</li>

<li>OVN L3 multicast implementation for switches (IGMP Snooping) and for
  routing across logical networks (IGMP Relay) along with packet flow.</li>

<li>An IGMP based solution for IP multicast connectivity in
  OVN-kubernetes in switch-per-node topologies.</li>

connect the overlay networks for different tenants. While it is
possible to achieve the same with existing VPN technologies, native

presents the design and implementation of the native OVN support for
multi-tenant tunneling between different OVN deployments. It also
discusses the related solutions for gateway load balancing and

<h3 id="4.1L"><a href="#s4.1L">How to dump your miniflow bits.</a> (Ian Stokes, Intel)</h3>

<p>In OVS 2.12, the Datapath Classifier code was refactored to enable the
specialization of specific subtables based on miniflow attributes
which, in turn, enhances the performance of subtable searches. An
initial set of these specialized subtables was implemented to
correspond to common traffic patterns.  However, as there are many
different patterns possible, there is a chance that users will not
benefit from a corresponding performance gain unless a specialized
subtable exists in the codebase that corresponds to this pattern.
Adding new specializations is easy but identifying the subtable
miniflow bits that are needed to specialize the subtables for their
use-case is more difficult. To help in this effort we are proposing a
new OVS command e.g.  ovs-appctl dpctl/dump miniflow bits. This talk
will seek to give an overview of the command, usage, and demonstrate
an example of traffic patterns to miniflow bit matches.</p>

<p>Data plane programmability and the P4 language have become the next
step in the evolution of Software-Defined Networking enabling
programming of protocol-independent packet parsers and packet
processing pipeline for network devices. Recently, the PISCES solution
demonstrated the feasibility of a protocol-independent software switch
using P4 as the programming language and Open vSwitch as the target
switch. However, PISCES requires re-compilation every time the P4
program is changed and in some situations the hypervisor switch needs
to be upgraded and/or customized at runtime in order to support new
protocol headers, encapsulation techniques or even implement
middlebox-like network functions. In this talk I would like to present
the runtime programming of extensions for Open vSwitch using the P4
language.  The solution is based on the Oko switch, the extension to
Open vSwitch, which allows to inject user-space BPF programs acting as
stateful packet filter.  We have enhanced the Oko switch with support
for programmable actions (packet modifications, tunneling), new APIs
to control BPF maps, the P4-to-uBPF compiler with support for stateful
P4 objects (registers) and the P4Runtime-based abstraction layer.  In
the presentation I will describe the design and implementation of the
solution. Moreover, the presentation will include discussion about
implementation problems that we faced and performance optimizations
that we applied to the P4 compiler. To sum up, our contribution to
Open vSwitch allows to dynamically reconfigure Open vSwitch&#x27;s packet
processing pipeline using the high-level domain-specific language
(DSL) such as P4 and protocol-independent SDN control protocol such as
P4Runtime.</p>

<p>Moreover, our enhancements enable running stateful, middlebox-like
network functions inside Open vSwitch. This feature can be used by
tenants to offload part of packet processing functionalities from
virtual machines to the virtual networking layer. Therefore, based on
our contribution we also would like to revive the idea of Topology
Service Injection for OpenStack - the Neutron plugin to inject
middlebox-like functions into the OpenStack network
infrastructure. With the use of the P4 language and P4-capable Open
vSwitch the Topology Service Injection plugin would not be limited by
the features provided by the OpenFlow architecture. Thus, we also
would like to propose a new, P4-based design of Topology Service
Injection plugin for OpenStack, which would support more powerful data
plane applications that can be injected into the networking layer.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean has been a long-time user of Open vSwitch as a core
element of it’s networking architecture. But until recently, the
various networking teams did not have a unified method of testing
datapath changes. We began to address these concerns this year through
the creation of a testing framework.</p>

<p>This session will highlight our journey building our datapath
validation framework. We will present what we express via our
datapath, the way we test it, and the challenges that we face. As a
result, listeners can expect to learn how to specifically leverage
go-openvswitch for their own testing needs.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<p>Many products at DigitalOcean use a set of tables and flows inserted
via Open vSwitch to form our datapath. These include customer-facing
products, such as load balancer, floating IP, firewall, VPC as well as
many internal core primitives like the metadata service, DHCP, an ARP
proxy, north-south gateways, etc.</p>

<p>The teams behind these products are constantly developing new features
and deprecating old ones. Much of that logic ends up being expressed
through our datapath, which increases its level of complexity.</p>

<p>The goal of the datapath validation framework is to make sure that
these teams are not conflicting with each other while quickly
iterating through their modifications of the datapath. It is also
vital to confirm that introduced changes don&#x27;t cause datapath
regression.</p>

<h3 id="5.2L"><a href="#s5.2L">Balance-TCP Bond Mode Performance Improvement</a> (Vishal Deep Ajmera, Nitin Katiyar, Venkatesan Pradeep, and Anju Thomas, Ericsson)</h3>

<p>Existing implementation of bond mode ‘balance-tcp’ uses hash() and
recirc() datapath actions. After recirculation, the packet is
forwarded to the bond member port based on 8-bits of dp_hash value
calculated in the datapath.</p>

<p>This mechanism has two issues:</p>

<p>Additional recirculation of packet degrades the performance of
‘balance-tcp’ mode when compared with ‘balance-slb’.</p>

<p>After recirculation if the packet is to egress on tunnel port (for
e.g. VxLAN or GRE), dp_hash is calculated over the tunnel header and
so tenant traffic is not load balanced effectively.</p>

<p>We propose introducing a new load-balancing output action lb-output
instead of hash() &amp; recirc().</p>

<p>Maintain one table per-bond (an array of uint16’s) which maps RSS hash
to a bond output port. This table is populated using same algorithm
that the ofproto layer is using today for creating dp_hash flows. This
table is looked up in lb-output action processing thus avoiding
recirculation.</p>

<p>As the recirculation is avoided, the RSS hash available from the
incoming packet (from tenant virtual machine) is used to determine the
output port from a given bond table. This ensures better distribution
of traffic across bond ports when using tunnels.</p>

<p>Statistics are maintained for each bond table entry to balance load
dynamically across bond ports.</p>

<p>Data path processing of high throughput networks introduce huge CPU
overheads, thus making HW offload a must requirement for hyperscale
computing, telecom etc. The OVS HW offload architecture enables
incremental introduction of HW offload features while allowing flows
to be either fully offloaded, where all the processing is done in HW,
partially offloaded, where the hardware performs some of the flow
rules and actions, or not offloaded at all where the packet processing
is entirely executed in software.</p>

<p>The talk will recap the OVS infrastructure for hardware offloads while
focusing on the HW offloads model of tunneling and connection tracking
for OVS DPDK using rte_flow.</p>

<p>Open vSwitch (OvS) is a widely deployed open source virtual switch
today.  In last three years, OvS acceleration has become increasingly
important to enhance the flow processing and packet forwarding
performance of OvS. There have been several flow acceleration
frameworks including Linux TC Flower, DPDK rte_flow, and eBPF in
existence now for OvS acceleration. That being said, have we reached
the maturity for OvS acceleration? Do we need all these frameworks for
OvS acceleration? What are the gaps in OvS acceleration? Are the
perceived performance benefits of OvS acceleration achievable in real
deployments? In this panel, we will try to discuss these questions and
many more across a group of panelists to help the community understand
the current state of OvS acceleration.</p>

<h3 id="6.1L"><a href="#s6.1L">Upcall rate limiting</a> (Vishal Deep Ajmera, Nitin Katiyar, Venkatesan Pradeep, and Anju Thomas, Ericsson)</h3>

<p>In OVS-DPDK , both slow path and fast path execute in the context of
the PMD thread.  This means that new flows leading to upcalls can
increase the latency of other packets which are serviced by the same
PMD.  Sudden burst of such flows can also lead intermittent traffic
drop for already learnt flows .  This also make OVS-DPDK vulnerable
for DoS attacks.</p>

<p>We propose a solution that would implement a per port upcall rate
limiting to ensure that service for other ports on the PMD is not
affected or worse denied.  We defined a upcall rate per port using a
CLI like:</p>

<p>    ovs-vsctl set port &lt;port name&gt; upcall-rate-limit</p>

<p>A simple token bucket policer per port per PMD restricts the flow of
packets from fast-path into slow-path.  This Upcall Policer allows
only configured number of packets per second (pps) into upcall.  A
packet entering slow-path has to take a token to get into slow-path
and if no tokens are available, the packet is dropped.</p>

analysis reports for OVS-DPDK with single VM scenario or limited port
numbers.  But the typical characteristics of cloud is huge VM numbers
and overlay network. In this case, the performance testing will be
more complex, and the performance result will be different.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will cover following parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Benchmark settings, following part will be considered in test
  settings: flow numbers, VM numbers, the packet receiving sequence
  pattern and VXLAN operations.</li>

<li>Performance analysis based on perf and vTune</li>

<p>Increasing demand of network throughput poses challenges for server
and networking equipment. Arm is a popular architecture in embedded
systems and is launching products for server, which can provide useful
features for packet processing.  This presentation introduces our
ongoing work of performance optimization on Arm and the new Arm
features that can benefit the data path.</p>

<ol>
<li>Arm has a weak memory model. Hardware re-ordering improves packet
   processing performance but it requires careful lock-free software
   implementation and correct ordering rules.  The read-write
   concurrency library is a good place to take this advantage.</li>

<li>Atomics support is enhanced in the newer generations of Arm
   architecture.  It solves some data contended and memory bouncing
   issues in large systems.</li>

<li>SIMD in Arm is better at parallel processing of small and
   contiguous data, which can improve some basic operators in OVS
   library. And the next generation of SIMD brings hope for parallel
   processing of large and non-contiguous data blocks. It can widen
   the scope to apply vector data processing.</li>

<p>DigitalOcean is undergoing a major overhaul of its droplet network
infrastructure. Until now, public IP traffic was carried among
droplets and the internet over a large flat layer 2 data center (DC)
network.</p>

<p>While an L2 network offers full mobility of IP addresses throughout an
L2 zone, it presented some pains as DigitalOcean began to scale. The
sheer volume of broadcast traffic from ARP requests alone makes for a
very noisy network, with every hypervisor (HV) seeing every request.
Additionally, tying subnets to L2 zones created IP mobility issues
between zones and, potentially, DCs.</p>

<p>What is the solution? We chose to move to an L3-based infrastructure.
This session will show our journey from L2 to L3 in detail. It will
highlight how we leveraged OvS to make this change, using parallel
active data paths and pivot points to switch between them. OvS
continues to be a key element in the L3 network going forward.</p>

<p>We will share all of the pitfalls and innovations that got us to where
we are along with all that we have left to do.</p>

<h3 id="8.1L"><a href="#s8.1L">Dynamic disabling/enabling of EMC based on traffic pattern</a> (Vishal Deep Ajmera, Nitin Katiyar, Venkatesan Pradeep, and Anju Thomas, Ericsson)</h3>

<p>There are systems which regularly encounter traffic pattern such that
there are constant evictions and insertions in the EMC cache.  This
EMC thrashing downgrades the system and prevents it from performing to
its maximum potential.  Even though there are options to manually
disable EMC in OVS using CLI today, this pattern may be fluctuating
and hence we might not want to disable this cache permanently, rather
disable/enable based on traffic pattern dynamically.</p>

<p>The proposal is to identify EMC thrashing and to dynamically disable
it and then to enable it back again when the situation has recovered.
We measure the state of EMC at regular time intervals. If EMC
thrashing is observed for multiple such time intervals for a given
PMD, we will disable EMC for that PMD.  Once EMC is disabled, we will
do a dry run at regular time intervals to check if we can enable EMC
back. If we find that dry run yields a positive result for consecutive
intervals, we will enable EMC again.  This feature can be enabled via
a CLI for the system along with other configuration parameters like
time interval, threshold values.</p>

<p>Today&#x27;s cellular networks attempt to take a rigidly standardized set
of network architectures and processes and apply them across all
contexts. This approach is reaching its limits: even 2G network
coverage has left behind 800M people, with 3G or better covering
substantially lower percentages of the population.  The technology
problem of connecting the next billion is the problem of dealing with
heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in deployment landscape, heterogeneity in
access technologies (LTE/WiFi), features sets and in the user
base. Thus, the right network architecture is one that is most
flexible, easiest to scale (up/down), and makes the broadest use of
backhaul technologies. In this talk we will cover our implementation
of a converged access network that fully distributes the core network
functionality by leveraging openvswitch at the edge to offer this
flexibility. We would also like to briefly cover our interest in
co-developing stateful and L3 gateway functions in OVS to better
support our use case.</p>
