<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<h3 id="t1">Observing Open vSwitch with native prometheus metrics <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Gaetan Rivet, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
Open vSwitch powers a diverse range of virtualized networking stacks,
and observability remains a challenge. Existing external tools often
assume a kernel datapath, introducing gaps when moving to userspace
implementations. They also impose overhead by scraping internals via
multiple CLI calls, which narrows what can be observed and limits
measurement frequency.

This talk introduces a native, Prometheus-compatible metrics framework
in the OVS library. It aligns observability across kernel and userspace
datapaths from an external observer perspective, providing a single
access path to relevant events.  The result is more accurate, granular
visibility with lower footprint, enabling higher frequency measurements
without distorting datapath behavior and reducing friction when
integrating controllers.

I will describe the Prometheus data model and the metric types
implemented in the framework, then discuss trade-offs and design choices
for the metric arborescence and access patterns:

  * Metric node types
  * Bounded collections for label generation
  * Conditional access to optional modules
  * Threading model

Finally, I will show usage in practice with metrics defined in the common
ofproto layer and specialized metrics made possible in the userspace
datapath.
</pre>

<h3 id="t2">Enhancing hardware offload insights in OVS <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Nupur Uttarwar, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
In Open vSwitch, troubleshooting rule offloading often requires digging
through logs and cross-referencing system components, especially when
offload fails or is unsupported. This short talk introduces enhancements
to the “dpctl dump-flows” command that provide explicit per-rule failure
if any directly in the flow dump output. With these improvements, users
gain streamlined troubleshooting and clearer insight into the offloading
pipeline, accelerating root-cause analysis and system fine-tuning.

    This talk will cover the following:

    *   Motivation for improving flow offload visibility and transparency
    *   Overview of new enhancements: error detection, propagation, and
        exposure in the data path

Finally, I will show the usage in practice where the offload fails and
how users can benefit from immediate, actionable feedback on offload
failures.
</pre>

<h3 id="t3">AI-Powered Performance Insights: Integrating OVS/OVN automatic performance regression analysis with LLMs <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Joe Talerico, Red Hat; Jose Castillo Lema, Red Hat; Mohit Sheth, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Performance engineering is critical for ensuring Kubernetes networking
scalability and stability, yet traditional regression analysis is slow
and manual. At Red Hat, performance testing has shifted left, allowing
developers to  run scale workloads against pull requests early in the
cycle. To accelerate feedback, we introduce Orion, a Python library for
automated statistical regression detection, and Orion-MCP,  an MCP
server that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze results,
detect anomalies, and provide natural-language insights. Together, these
tools make performance data more accessible and actionable, helping
developers quickly identify and address regressions in evolving
Kubernetes networking code.
</pre>

<h3 id="t4">OpenFlow Classifier: Arcane knowledge and common pitfalls <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Ilya Maximets, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
The OpenFlow classifier is the brain and the heart of Open vSwitch, but not
many people these days know how it actually works.  Some of the knowledge is
hidden behind the complex code, motivation for some features and optimizations
is lost in time, since the original authors of this code stepped away from the
project long ago.

This talk is a deep dive into inner workings of the classifier, aiming to shed
some light on the architecture and optimizations, explaining common "do"s and
"don't"s of writing efficient OpenFlow pipelines with regards to issues that
OVN faced in the recent years.
</pre>

<h3 id="t5">Uncovering Testing Gaps in OVN Incremental Processing <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Jacob Tanenbaum, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
The incremental processing of OVN objects greatly decreases the
processing time of changes to the OVN database, this leads to increases in
scale and ability to handle database changes. Assuming that all the changes
are handled correctly. The current state of testing for the incremental
processor has a large oversight that the project needs to address.
Comparing the output of the incremental processor to a forced recalculation
of the database leaves room for bugs and unforeseen interactions that may
not be accounted for. We need a new method of testing that can account for
interactions between runs of the incremental processor that are not
currently accounted for.
</pre>

<h3 id="t6">Improving Retrieval from the OVS Hashmap <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Rosemarie O'Riorden, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
The OVS hashmap is used all throughout OVN and OVS for a variety of data
storage. With very frequent data retrieval, any bit of performance
improvement is beneficial. Valkey recently published a blog about changes
they made to their hashmap, and how they saw significantly less memory
usage, so I want to build off their design and implement something similar
for OVS. This will hopefully lessen cache misses, thus improving overall
performance.
</pre>

<h3 id="t7">The BGP Fork in the Road: A Tale of Two Implementations <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Jaime Caamaño Ruiz, Red Hat; Patryk Diak, Red Hat; Surya Seetharaman, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
In the world of networking, two paths diverged in a yellow wood, and
OVN-Kubernetes took the one less traveled by. When it comes to BGP support,
both OVN and OVN-Kubernetes developed their own implementations almost
simultaneously. It was a classic "great minds think alike" situation, but
instead of joining forces, they each went their own way. Now we're left
with a tale of two distinct BGP implementations, each with its own quirks
and charms.

This talk will pull back the curtain on this intriguing parallel
development. We'll start by exploring how OVN handles BGP, from its core
design to its capabilities. Then, we'll dive into the OVN-Kubernetes
approach, revealing how it provides BGP support for your workloads. We'll
highlight the key differences between these two implementations and, more
importantly, identify the gaps that currently prevent OVN-Kubernetes from
simply adopting OVN's native BGP support.

Finally, we'll get down to brass tacks: what would it take for
OVN-Kubernetes to make the switch? We'll analyze the pros and cons of such
a move, discussing the technical challenges and potential benefits. This
talk isn't just about code; it's about the journey of open source
development and the sometimes-messy reality of building great things in
parallel. Join us for a fun and informative look at two BGPs, and help us
decide if it's time for them to finally become one.
</pre>

<h3 id="t8">A Nightmare on Kube Street: Slicing Kubernetes Networks like Freddy Krueger <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Dave Tucker, Red Hat; Surya Seetharaman, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) are the network isolation dream that major cloud
providers have perfected—but for those of us running Kubernetes, our networks
can feel more like a nightmare. Despite recent advances in network policies and
segmentation, we're still stuck in a flat network hellscape where true
multi-tenant isolation feels impossibly complex.

What if we could slice through this chaos like Freddy himself? What if we
could give teams the power to carve out their own isolated network territories
while still allowing controlled communication between them?

In this talk, we'll unveil a new OVN-Kubernetes feature that brings true VPC
functionality to your clusters. Building on the recently added User-Defined
Networks (UDNs) foundation—which provides isolated network primitives—our VPC
implementation allows you to group these networks together and define
communication policies between them. Think of it as NetworkPolicy's bigger,
more powerful sibling that operates at the network topology level rather than
just the pod level.

We'll start with a tour of VPC concepts from AWS and NSX, then dive deep into
our OVN implementation. You'll see how we leverage OVN logical switches,
routers, and policies to create true network segmentation that goes beyond
what traditional Kubernetes networking offers. We'll demonstrate our working
prototype in action, showing how development teams can own their network
topology while platform teams maintain control over inter-network communication.

Join us as we slice through the technical implementation details and show you
how OVS and OVN make this VPC nightmare-turned-dream a reality. By the end,
you'll understand the architecture, see it working, and know how this feature
will transform multi-tenant Kubernetes networking.

Sweet dreams are made of properly isolated networks!

<h3 id="t9">OVN and BGP: A Friendship Forged in OpenStack Neutron <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Jakub Libosvar, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
This talk explores the integration of OVN's BGP capabilities within OpenStack
Neutron, the networking component of the OpenStack project. We will begin with
a concise overview of key Neutron components to provide essential context for
attendees unfamiliar with OpenStack. Following this, we will break down the OVN
logical components responsible for advertising prefixes throughout the topology.
The session will also feature a short live demonstration showing the OVN BGP
integration with Neutron in action. The goal of this session is to present how
OVN innovations are adopted by other projects.
</pre>

<h3 id="t10">Accelerating OVN Dynamic Routing: OVN-BGP Agent + OVS-DPDK Fast Data Path Performance on RHOSO 18 <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Pradipta Sahoo, Red Hat; Haresh Khandelwal, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Achieving both dynamic routing flexibility and high-speed packet forwarding
remains a central challenge in cloud networking. In this talk, we present
performance results from a proof-of-concept integration of OVN-BGP-Agent
with the OVS-DPDK fast data path on Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift
(RHOSO) 18.
Our evaluation on high-capacity hardware with dual 100 Gbps NICs shows:

   - Line-rate throughput at 100 Gbps aggregate with large frames and
   negligible packet loss.
   - 12+ hours of sustained stability under continuous small-frame traffic,
   with no BGP session flaps.
   - Key scalability constraints for small packets, stemming from single Rx
   queue usage, flow setup overhead, and MAC binding limits in the datapath.

We will examine these trade-offs between routing agility and forwarding
performance, and share tuning strategies and architectural considerations
to advance OVN dynamic routing toward production-grade readiness. Attendees
will gain actionable insights into optimizing OVS/OVN for demanding,
real-world dynamic routing deployments.
</pre>

<h3 id="t11">A native way of integrating OVN into the fabric through BGP-EVPN. <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Ales Musil, Red Hat; Dumitru Ceara, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Since version 25.03, OVN has had native support for integrating with
L3 fabrics through BGP.  We now present the work that happened in
25.09 to extend this native support in order to stretch OVN virtual L2
domains into and across the fabric through BGP-EVPN.

The talk will give an overview of the targeted use cases for BGP-EVPN
in cloud deployments and of how OVN virtual L2 domains are implemented.
We'll then show how the new OVN native support can be used for connecting
the two.

The newly added OVN BGP-EVPN support is marked as experimental in 25.09
therefore we're also seeking feedback from the audience regarding the
design decisions we have made when implementing the feature.  In order
to facilitate that we'll go into the technical details of the solution
and present:
- how and where the BGP control plane is supposed to be configured and
  is expected to run
- how OVN integrates with the BGP control plane in order to learn remote
  VTEPs (VXLAN tunnel endpoints)
- how OVN programs its dataplane in order to forward traffic through
  remote VTEPs according to the BGP control plane information
- how OVN learns and exposes remote and local workloads through EVPN

The talk will also present the plan to extend the implementation in
order to further support more ways to integrate with the fabric BGP-EVPN
infrastructure.
</pre>

<h3 id="t12">Virtual Network Function integration in OVN <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Sragdhara Datta Chaudhuri, Nutanix; Naveen Yerramneni, Nutanix</h3>
<pre>
This feature addresses a long-standing request in OVN by adding the ability
to insert a virtual network function (VNF), such as a third-party firewall,
into the traffic path. It supports both VLAN and overlay subnets and follows
a "bump-in-the-wire" model. Packets matching an access list are forwarded
through the port pair of a VNF. Stateful behavior is maintained by forwarding
response packets through the same port pair. For cross-host communication,
tunneling is enforced for traffic to and from the node hosting the VNF.

Users can group multiple instances of a VNF together. The health of the group
members is monitored using data path probe packets. Users have the option to
either select one healthy member or load balance across all healthy members.
Additionally, there is a configuration option to choose between fail-close and
fail-open behavior, which dictates whether traffic will be dropped or
forwarded (bypassing the VNF) when all group members are unhealthy.

In addition to the inline mode VNF described above, users can alternatively
create a VNF in tap mode. In this mode, packets matching an access list — and
their associated responses—are cloned and forwarded to the VNF, while the
original traffic continues along the normal forwarding path.

The solution introduces new pipeline stages in logical switch, new
northbound (NB) entities related to network function, a new action in
access-list and a new type of health monitoring in ovn-controller. It also
makes use of connection tracking labels to support traffic redirection for
response packets and to enforce tunneling behaviour.

Current status of the feature: Code review in progress -

<h3 id="t13">OVN-Kubernetes Meets DPUs: Enabling Service Function Chaining and Shared OVN <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Tim Rozet, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
Modern cloud-native environments are increasingly adopting DPUs and advanced
networking architectures to deliver high-performance, secure, and flexible
services. This talk will explore how OVN-Kubernetes integrates with DPUs, and
how this integration is driving new feature requirements in OVN itself.

One such feature, "Shared OVN", enables a single OVN instance to serve
multiple control management systems (CMS), one per DPU and one for the host
cluster. We will discuss why this capability is critical for the DPU use case,
and how it is designed to provide isolation and scalability.

Another requirement, Service Function Chaining (SFC), introduces the ability to
steer traffic through a sequence of security, auditing, and accounting
functions on the DPU before it leaves the host cluster. We will cover the
expected architecture for SFC in OVN, along with the current status of its
enhancement proposal.

Attendees will gain insight into the DPU use case with OVN-Kubernetes, and new
features required in OVN. This talk also serves as a call to action to help
move these features forward.

<h3 id="t14">Transit router - The distributed router for OVN interconnect. <a href="#day1">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Ales Musil, Red Hat; Mairtin O'Loingsigh, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
OVN interconnect is a way to connect multiple OVN deployments
in a managed way without the need to setup the tunnels manually. So
far there has only been support for Transit Switch which allows the
Transit Switch Ports to be part of different Availability Zones.
However, there wasn't any simple way to setup routing across
Availability Zones. The Transit Router aims to solve that issue.
The main goal of Transit Router is to have distributed router that
has ports across Availability Zones to leverage the Logical Router
capabilities in ovn-ic deployment.

The aim of this talk is to introduce the Transit Router capabilities
and limitations. With a focus on the internal details and the
configuration needed to have a working OVN IC deployment that can
leverage the Transit Router. At the end we would like to discuss some
open-ended questions for potential improvements.

<h3 id="t15">One API to Rule Them All: Reworking the OVS Hardware Offload Layers <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Eelco Chaudron, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Open vSwitch (OVS) currently supports hardware offload through implementations
that are tightly coupled to the dpif-provider layer. While this approach works,
it has led to a relatively rigid model where each provider integrates offload
capabilities in its own way, making it harder to extend and share functionality
across vendors.

Today, OVS supports multiple backends for offload: the kernel datapath
leverages the TC flower classifier, while the userspace datapath integrates
with DPDK using rte_flow. Both paths expose their functionality through the
netdev-offload APIs, but the current design results in duplicated logic and
limits opportunities for consistency and reuse. For example, vendor-specific
capabilities must often be reimplemented in each provider, and adding new
offload features requires invasive changes in multiple places.

This talk will introduce a proposal for a new dpif-offload API layer in OVS.
The goal is to provide a unified and more flexible abstraction for hardware
offload that sits above the provider-specific implementations. By centralizing
offload handling, we can simplify vendor integration, reduce duplication, and
allow for more extensible offload pipelines. Ultimately, this design aims to
make it easier for vendors to plug their hardware-specific implementations,
while giving operators a more consistent and maintainable offload experience.

<h3 id="t16">OVS-DOCA live-upgrade <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Eli Britstein, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
In a production environment it is required to update OVS daemon version, mainly for bug fixes.
This update procedure requires to have minimal effects both for down-time and workloads interruption.

Today, this requires a full restart of the daemon, which have mainly the
following challenges:
1. Ports initialization, especially with offloads.
2. There are many volatile states that are gone and must be re-learned or
   re-configured by a controller.
                a. Openflow.
                                i. Meters.
                                ii. Groups.
                                iii. TLV-map.
                                iv. Rules.
                b. Connection tracking connections.
                c. FDB (MAC learning).
                d. User configured routes.
                e. Tunnel neighbour resolution tables.
                f. More...
3. Connection tracking TCP sessions are disconnected and must be re-established.

This talk will go through how OVS-DOCA achieves that.

DOCA is capable to initialize the same ports from different userspace processes
and zero-time handover.

The concept in OVS is to enable invoking the new version in client mode, in
parallel to the existing running version (the server).  While two instances are
running, the following is done:
1. The server continues to handle the current workloads.
2. New instances (ports, offloads) initialization is done in parallel.
3. States are migrated to the new instance.
4. Handover.
5. Termination of the server instance.

We’ll also discuss version and resource constraints, failure handling and
rollback.

<h3 id="t17">OVS-DOCA upstream roadmap <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Maor Dickman, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
Modern cloud workloads demand extremely high bandwidth and minimal latency. To
meet these requirements, it is crucial for Open vSwitch (OVS) to utilize
hardware acceleration with specialized devices, which enhances scalability,
lowers CPU usage, and enables efficient processing at speeds reaching hundreds
of gigabits per second.

OVS-DOCA, an advanced downstream version of OVS available from NVIDIA, delivers
top-tier acceleration on NVIDIA network interface cards (NICs) through a
userspace implementation and supports extensive offload capabilities, achieving
exceptional packet-per-second (PPS) and connection-per-second (CPS) performance.

This presentation will address the architectural differences between OVS-DOCA
and the upstream OVS solution and will cover the plans to upstream OVS-DOCA
acceleration, building on the existing dpif-netdev userspace framework.

The updated architecture involves enhancing dpif-netdev in the following ways:

  1.  netdev_class doca_class (netdev_doca)  - New netdev
     * Responsibilities: Port initialization and SW handling based on
       DOCA-ETH (slow path)
  2.  dpif-offload-doca - New dpif-offload-provider using on DOCA-FLOW, based
      on new dpif-provider API.
     * Responsibilities: offload megaflows.
  3.  CT offloads DOCA offload provider - New offload API for userspace
      connection tracking based DOCA connection tracking offload.

<h3 id="t18">Baremetal network isolation for cloud providers with OVN on DPUs <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Adrian Chiris, NVIDIA; Mael Kimmerlin, NVIDIA; Tarek Abu-Hariri, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
Bare-metal nodes in cloud platforms are increasingly used for workloads
demanding direct hardware access paired with high performance, yet these nodes
present acute challenges for secure multi-tenancy and strong network isolation.
Traditional isolation approaches for Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) often rely on
switch configuration management, which introduces operational complexity,
exposure to configuration errors, and risks of side-channel or unauthorized
cross-tenant communication. As networks scale or tenants rotate frequently,
these methods quickly become bottlenecks, reducing agility and potentially
compromising security.

We present a network isolation architecture for VPC, that leverages the NVIDIA
BlueField-3 DPU to offload Open Virtual Network (OVN) and Open vSwitch (OVS)
dataplane functionalities. In this model, the DPU, under exclusive control of
the cloud administrator, enforces strict network isolation for tenants in a way
that is entirely transparent to the host and requires no switch-level
modifications when tenants are added or reassigned. With DPUs running in a
secure domain, separate from the host operating system, all network traffic
enforcement, including tenant segmentation, policy enforcement, packet
inspection, and line-rate forwarding is handled transparently and securely. The
DPU administrator, not the node tenant or host OS, manages all network
isolation mechanisms, ensuring tenant boundaries cannot be compromised even by
privileged host processes. Since the DPU accelerates OVS and OVN, the cloud
administrator can offer all the expected features of a VPC (external
connectivity, DHCP, floating IP addresses etc.) at line-rate speed, with
maximum bandwidth and minimum latency.

Isolation policies and network topologies are exposed through a declarative
Kubernetes API, allowing operators to map bare-metal machines to tenants
dynamically without operational complexity. The solution implements a
specialized OVN topology optimized for high-performance bare-metal
communication, sustaining line-rate throughput both between nodes and for
external communications. This approach combines the flexibility of
software-defined networking with the performance of hardware offload, delivering
scalable, secure, and operationally lightweight tenant isolation for bare-metal
cloud environments.

<h3 id="t19">Deprecating Code <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Simon Horman, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
OVS is a long running project. In time it has accumulated many features contributed by a
large number of developers. However, as time has moved on, some features have become
unused, while their maintenance burden remains.

This presentation aims to explore options for deprecating such code. As well as suggesting
some code to which this may apply. It is intended to be interactive, soliciting input from the
audience on an appropriate way forward.

<h3 id="t20">Revisiting checksum offloads in OVS <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): David Marchand, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
OVS checksum offloads API and TSO support for the userspace datapath
was introduced in multiple steps over several years and has grown more
complex with the addition of tunnel support recently.
The close ties with the DPDK checksum offloads API resulted in complex
operations in OVS packet processing. And here complex means bugs were
present.

This talk will present the recent revamp of this API: from the initial
fixes and the unit tests coverage additions, to the new API, its
enhanced readbility and the (hopefully) easier maintenance such as
better isolation of the API from the DPDK and Linux kernel offloads
API.

As part of this talk, performance numbers with some popular nics will
be discussed.

<h3 id="t21">You Want to Upgrade WHAT? A Field Guide to Risky Network Changes <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Nadia Pinaeva, NVIDIA; Dumitru Ceara, Red Hat; Patryk Diak, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Every active project accumulates technical debt. For OVN-Kubernetes, our Layer2
network topology, a result of incremental additions and unfortunate design
choices, had hit its limit. Not only did it make different topologies support
more complicated than it should be, it also imposed feature limitations for
EgressIP, Virtual Machines live migration and Network Interconnect. A
re-architecture was unavoidable.

This session details how we leveraged the OVN Transit Router to redesign our L2
network from the ground up for stability and scale. But the real story isn’t
just the new design: having customers already using this feature in production
introduced an interesting set of network engineering challenges to solve. If
you have never:

  * Connected the same switch and router with 2 links
  * Copied the same MAC on multiple ports
  * Generated dummy IPs just to fix routing
  * Hand-crafted Route Advertisements to remove stale routes

Join our session and follow along on our topology upgrade adventure!

<h3 id="t22">Space - building a CMS with OVN Concepts <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Felix Huettner, StackIt</h3>
<pre>
When our existing OpenStack Neutron deployment could no longer meet
new requirements, we decided to build an additional CMS based on OVN
design concepts.

In this talk we will share how we adapted these concepts to our
implementation of "spaced".

We will walk through the core components of our system: a new
"spacebound" OVSDB for defining resources and "spaced" that acts as a
custom northd. Spaced translates our high-level requirements into the
standard OVN northbound database.  It thereby integrates with the Resources
that OpenStack Neutron is still managing in northbound.

If you were hoping that this talk is actually about running OVN in
space, then sorry for making you excited.

<h3 id="t23">Programming OVS bridges using OVN Bridge Controller <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Numan Siddique, Crusoe AI</h3>
<pre>
If an external controller wants to program an OVS bridge, it has to
either talk OpenFlow protocol or make use of ovs-ofctl utility.  With
the proposed new service OVN bridge controller, a user can program an
OVS bridge using the OVN logical flow syntax.  This new service will
convert these logical flows to Open Flow rules and program the OVS
bridges just like ovn-controller programs br-int.  This talk gives an
overview of how to use this service and shows how it becomes easier to
program the OVS bridges.

<h3 id="t24">Beam Me Through the Datapath: VDUSE for OpenShift Virtualization <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Jakob Meng, Red Hat; Maxime Coquelin, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Last year, we replaced the kernel-based networking stack in OpenShift –
Red Hat's Kubernetes distribution for hybrid clusters – with OVS-DPDK and
VDUSE: Traffic between NICs and containers is handled end-to-end entirely in
userspace. This year, we are closing the gap for virtual machines: We extended
OVN-Kubernetes and KubeVirt to use userspace datapaths exclusively with VDUSE
and vhost-vDPA. In our talk, we propose a new network architecture for
KubeVirt VMs, provide a deep dive into OVS-DPDK performance tuning in
OpenShift, and once again share preliminary but transparent benchmark results.

<h3 id="t25">OvS and Socket Maps - Beyond ports as endpoints <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Aaron Conole, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Open vSwitch provides an implementation of a layer 2 switch, with some
awareness of both layer 3 and layer 4 networking details.  This
awareness can be considered a violation of concerns, but with the
trade off that Open vSwitch can provide a greater flexibility when
authoring network policies for end users.

Here we propose a new layer violation - using application ports as
packet endpoints.  Existing kernel datapath accelerations, ie XDP, can
be made aware of application details for endpoints.  This, combined with
a socket enqueue support, allows for much higher throughput by skipping
those layer processing details that aren't needed (for example, routing
in layer 3, and the subsequent additional layer 3 + 4 processing inside
a target netns).

By focusing on the packet movement rather than strict layer adherence,
we show that Open vSwitch can provide an accelerated packet forwarding
path, and can do so in cooperation with the existing forwarding path.

<h3>Speaker(s): Thilak Raj Surendra Babu, ZScaler Inc.</h3>
<pre>
OVS connection tracking is a fundamental piece in the Dataplane fabric that
we use.
While it has improved in performance from OVS 3.0, It lacks the features
that the kernel connection tracking provides such as CT logging, Counters,

<h3 id="t27">Multiple NICs as Encapsulation Endpoints for Large Scale GPU Cloud <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Girish Moodalbail, NVIDIA; Han Zhou, NVIDIA</h3>
<pre>
Multi-node AI training and inference is becoming increasingly common due to the
growing size of LLMs. Within a single node, GPUs communicate through high-speed
interconnects such as PCIe and NVLINK. However, communication across multiple
nodes still heavily relies on Ethernet. Each GPU in a node is equipped with its
own dedicated NIC, enabling direct communication with GPUs in other nodes. For
example, if a node contains four GPUs, it will also have four NICs. This means
AI workloads are multi-homed, and all inter-node GPU overlay traffic will be
transported over the Encapsulation IP associated with each respective NIC. This
means we end up with multiple-encapsulation IPs on the same node.

In another scenario, cloud gaming workloads utilize dedicated NICs for
different functions: one for storage access and another for streaming
GPU-generated frames to end-user devices. These are used in addition to the
main interface that handles the gaming control plane traffic. As a result, the
storage, streaming, and primary workload traffic must each be transported over
the Encapsulation IP associated with each respective NIC.

In this session, we will demonstrate how multi-homed workloads can be supported
on multi-NIC nodes securely using ovn-kubernetes and OVN. We will explore the
fundamentals of multi-NIC support, along with the scalability challenges and
solutions needed for large-scale Multi-tenant GPU cloud environments.

<h3 id="t28">Turbocharge Kubernetes with offloaded OVN-Kubernetes and OVS on DPUs <a href="#day2">|TOP|</a></h3>
<h3>Speaker(s): Alin Serdean, NVIDIA; Amit Zala, NVIDIA; Mael Kimmerlin, NVIDIA; Vasilis Remmas, NVIDIA; Igal Tsoiref, Red Hat; Rom Freiman, Red Hat</h3>
<pre>
Running Kubernetes workloads with hardware-accelerated networking is
challenging, as existing CNIs either offer limited features, low performance,
or impose heavy resource overhead on hosts. Similarly, Service Function
Chaining (SFC) in cloud-native environments commonly relies on software-based
forwarding on general-purpose CPUs, which restricts scalability and performance.

We present a Kubernetes-native platform that offloads both orchestration and
service execution to NVIDIA BlueField-3 (BF3) Data Processing Units (DPUs). Our
approach extends Kubernetes APIs with CRDs for declarative configuration,
allowing services such as OVS, OVN-Kubernetes, routing, storage, and security
functions to be deployed and chained directly on the DPU. By combining the
programmability of OVS with BF3 hardware acceleration and DOCA capabilities,
traffic steering and service execution are fully offloaded from the host. We
ran a performance evaluation on BlueField 3 cards.

Our open-source platform integrates seamlessly into DevOps workflows through
Kubernetes-native interfaces and Infrastructure-as-Code practices, while also
integrating with enterprise-grade platforms such as OpenShift. The result is a
production-ready, DPU-accelerated networking solution that combines high
performance, scalability, and simplified orchestration for next-generation
cloud-native and AI workloads.
