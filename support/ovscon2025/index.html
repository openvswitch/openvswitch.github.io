title: Open vSwitch and OVN 2025 Fall Conference
---
<img src="/assets/conf2025.png">

<p>
    The Open vSwitch project, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project,
    will host its eleventh annual conference focused on Open vSwitch and
    OVN on November 19 - 20, 2025.  The conference will be hybrid.  Talks
    will be presented live during the conference.  We are planning to
    use an online system that allows for text-based discussion, and live
    Q&amp;A while the talk is happening for virtual attendees.  Each talk will have time
    reserved following the presentation for further discussion via both
    text, over video and audio, and live with the presenters.  Each talk will
    be given once.
</p>
<p>
    The in-person location for the conference this year will be at the
    Hotel Botanique (<a href="https://www.hotelbotanique.com/">here</a>) in Prague, CZ.
</p>


<h2>How to propose a Talk</h2>

<p>
    We are seeking long and short ("lightning") talks on topics related
    to Open vSwitch and OVN.  We expect long talks to last 25 minutes
    with an additional 5 minutes for questions, and short talks to last
    10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    We will also accept proposals for panel discussions and
    workshops.  Please submit them as full talks and make it clear in the
    description that you are proposing a panel or workshop.
</p>

<p>
    Please submit proposals
    to <a href="mailto:ovscon@openvswitch.org">ovscon@openvswitch.org</a>
    by September 8.  Proposals should include:
</p>

<ul>

    <li>Whether you are proposing a full talk or a lightning talk or

</ul>

<p>
    Speakers will be notified of acceptance by October 1st, 2025.
</p>

<p>Speakers should plan to attend the event in person.  Travel and
