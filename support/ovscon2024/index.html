title: Open vSwitch and OVN 2024 Fall Conference
---
<img src="/assets/conf2024.png">

<p>
    The Open vSwitch project, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project,
    will host its tenth annual conference focused on Open vSwitch and
    OVN on November 20&amp;21, 2024.  The conference will be hybrid.  Talks
    will be presented live during the conference.  We are planning to
    use an online system that allows for text-based discussion, and live
    Q&amp;A while the talk is happening for virtual attendees.  Each talk will have time
    reserved following the presentation for further discussion via both
    text, over video and audio, and live with the presenters.  Each talk will
    be given once.
</p>
<p>
    The in-person location for the conference this year will be at the
    Hotel Grandior (<a href="https://www.hotel-grandior.cz">here</a>) in Prague, CZ.
</p>

<h2>How to propose a Talk</h2>

    We are seeing long and short ("lightning") talks on topics related

    with an additional 5 minutes for questions, and short talks to last
    10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    We will also accept proposals for panel discussions and
    workshops.  Please submit them as full talks and make it clear in the
    description that you are proposing a panel or workshop.
