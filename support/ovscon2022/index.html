<h2>How to Propose a Talk</h2>

<p>
  We are soliciting proposals for full talks and short ("lightning")
  talks in a single round.  You may propose a talk as a full talk, a
  lightning talk, or for either one at the committee's discretion.
</p>

<p>
  We will also accept proposals for panel discussions.  Please submit
  them as full talks and make it clear in the description that it is a
  panel.
</p>

<p>
  Please submit proposals

  by August 29.  Proposals should include:
</p>

<ul>

  either one at the committee's discretion.</li>
</ul>
