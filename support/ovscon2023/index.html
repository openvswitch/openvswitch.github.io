title: Open vSwitch and OVN 2023 Fall Conference
---
<p>
    The Open vSwitch project, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project,
    will host its ninth annual conference focused on Open vSwitch and
    OVN on December 6&amp;7, 2023.  The conference will be held online.  Talks
    will be pre-recorded and played back during the conference.  We will
    use an online system that allows for text-based discussion, and live
    Q&amp;A while the talk is being played.  Each talk will have time
    reserved following the presentation for further discussion via both
    text and over video and audio with the presenters.  Each talk will
    be given once.
</p>

<h2>How to propose a Talk</h2>

<p>
    We are seeing long and short ("lightning") talks on topics related
    to Open vSwitch and OVN.  We expect long talks to last 25 minutes
    with an additional 5 minutes for questions, and short talks to last
    10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    We will also accept proposals for panel discussions and
    workshops.  Please submit them as full talks and make it clear in the
    description that you are proposing a panel or workshop.
